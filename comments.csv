Sheikh mansour's money is finally running out 😂😂😂😂
Wow 🔥villa put the champions into their pockets!
Why letting opponents coming to yo territory..? City seems all are defenders now. every one is running towards their own post which poor thing.
"Without Enderson in that Goal post, Manchester City 🏙️ wud ve beaten severely.. Otherwise city where poor in everything."
Villa won the match not by that solo goal by bailey but by The fact that villa played that kind of quality football against a treble winning team emery has really rallied his forces
Hi
1:37..6:30
NENSEEEEEEE
the double save of emi Martinez is unbelievable 😮
31 score on 31 lol 🥂🇯🇲🌏
"I’m city fã but I have to confess what performance by Aston Villa, well done they are in a good path Congratulations Emery and all the team. 
👏👏👏"
"EL DIBUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU CALLANDO BOCASSSSSSS, EL MEJOR ARQUEROOOOOO"
haaland can only score tap in's
Bring back kdb we need him
Aston villa will be taught a lesson when they come to city home next year! Mark my word and remember this day
С детства за Астон Виллу
Both goalies were excellent.
Muy believe~o
Aston villa & Unai Emery Watchout. This crazy Man
"Coming from a man city fan, hats off to Aston villa they really dominated throughout the whole game I cannot believe Man City only had 2 shots Unai Emery is working miracles."
Выйбали горожан как всегда
Man city is still missing de breane
Incredible come back of villas
Defeat at villa Park with an exclamation is crazyyyy😭😭😭😂😂
Победа астон вилы принесла столько радости.победа ман сити  не принемла столько бы радосьти.болельщики астон вилы заслужили
The 2 most overrated teams
Great work ethic from Villa
Ederson ❤❤
"I understand that players that were part of last season success are tired and have to find that hunger again but, this season they have not a lot but a few problems but for me biggest are that Haaland is missing to many goal chances and Kovačić is a overrated adition"
What a game
Pep should quit the team !!!
Halaand tanpa KDB is nothing
Yes
"mmm these Villains were angry, lets return Grealish maybe they might be nicer next time"
Emi Martinez is an absolutely beast
City absolutely got dominated by Villa. The loss was unexpected but this was almost unbelievable
Haha
"No matter what if we lose or win, McfcForever"
ah but can they beat city with no injuries
Gvardiol was confused as hell in this game 😒
Where Was Doku?
EZ
😂😂😂
Very lucky city ! They could get at least 5 !
Dibuje ❤
Позор денежного мешка
Emi was too hard to beat for Haaland and your attackers but it was good football
MId-Field is completely absent it seems🥲🥲
If no  saves by ederson  it will ends in 5 : 0 for villa
"After Barcelona,Now I'm become fan of Aston Villa❤"
Antony should be doing what Bailey is doing
Martinez is good but no doubt how much ederson's efforts
Villa have great fighting spirit.....
Guardiola's tactics are easy to read in the Premier League and the club doesn't have any good defenders...😂😂
Nice
I think city are losing form from earlier match too
Estoy solicitando a emry por Barcelona.
Ederson salvó a m city de una goleada 😅😅😅😅😅.
"Unai Emery clearly used the classic Spanish tactics which made Gvardiol look like crap CM; it's funny Liverpool is 1st on the table after Salah hit 200 goals place 5th goal scorer in history ov the club but Arsenal crying about ti
However, spurs man u Chelsea r becoming leftovers"
wow
"Wow Villa really played like City.  Well done. 
Just wanted to say i m amazed of how Guardiola can make a strong team once again even tho they sold so many great players in 1 year, and doesnt matter if they lost i know they ll come back again"
Man city will not win the league
Which City is this now?
Terrible defense
"What a beautiful match true spirit of EPL, which was missing.. Thank you, Austin villa, for super quality match...."
If rodri didn't start watching top boy he would be playing rn nd we would've won this game but this guy idk wt* happened 2 him y is he always getting cards now ffs
Gvardiol is gonna cost us big time if Pep keeps on playing him over Ake
Oh Man City looked terrible except Ederson
Y'all talking about City losing but not how Leon Dazzled them😊😅😅 LEON BAILEY
The second commentator was going to cry.
"Gardiola va encore perdre d'autres matchs
Gardiola est entrain de payer ses erreurs
Libérer Mahrez est une faute pour Manchester city"
HAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Сити играл ужасно 😢..У Гвардиолы кончились идеи...а без Кевина де Брюйне...нет идей на поле..нужен мозг...зачем отпустили Илкая Гюндогана не подыскав равноценной замены???..этот сезон провал всего тренерского штаба😔
Villa is on fire 🔥
haaland is inside the penalty box the whole game waiting for a ball to tap in no contribution in the game at all  🤦🤦🤦
"I see Leon the Lion has assisted the Ginn (A supernatural being in Arab folklore and Islamic teachings) (against Arsenal.
There is a rhythm to playing, defence and goal - not needing to try too hard (what happens when you try too hard!). On the ball.
Running through the gears like a pouncing cats (cats will never be a cliché. Don't eat me). Cats are up against it all the time, but they wont worry. They are geared to survive while taking it in their stride. City have been winning with ease and using respect. Sometimes you have to grit your teeth - Accept a difficult situation and deal with it in a determined way.
Summon up strength to bear pain, misfortune, or some other unpleasant matter, or determination for a difficult task.
Show courage and determination when dealing with problems or challenges.
We don't need to be stereotypical when we lose. It's an education. You don't get down. People (some) want you banging your heads against the wall like new born kittens that haven't got their sight yet."
Man city without Rodri is nothing🤣🤣🤣👋🏻
SAY ALHAMDULILLAH!!!🔥🔥
Emi martinaz saves wow
Geez the comments are filled with haters😑 will find a way city!!!
"Gvardiol’s defending on the LB is a felony, Ederson was easily our best player…such a disappointing performance."
The astron villains 🥶🔥
🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲 🥶
probably the first time seen city out classed in a premier lig match
"Ben alors, il est où le monstre Haaland ? le mec joue dans un championnat éclaté où les défenseurs sont des plots mais tout va bien. Et on critique m4bAPP2 :)"
City was trashed
This just shows how important kdb and rodri are to city without them we cant win. As a city fan i still have high hopes of still winning the premeir league as last season at this time we were behind arsenal by 8 points
Taktik 3 bek Pep sudah bisa dikalah kan butuh penyempurnaan
😢😢😢😢😢I don't wish to see this again 😢😢😢
Where nunez??
Why’s the commentator calling Ederson ‘Allison’??
"I blame pep, rico lewis is not a premier league level player"
🤦‍♂️🧟‍♂️
эдерсону памятник
"La diferencia de Haaland, Ronaldo y Embappe a Messi ed que no tienen visoon de pase tan facil como pasar al centro tener solo al compañero para hacer, el gol y prefieren dosparar"
Look at Gvardiol most expensive defender😂😂😂😂😂😂.. in the mud Bailey should be jailed.. criminal attacking
😂😂😂
"Very nice man city,"
All these city fans being happy and giving credits to villa for beating our team instead of being concerned of the condition of their team just proves that we have so many plastic fans as people always say
"Some credit should be given to Guardiola (i.e. and Man City) for inspiring an upgrade for all the teams in the EPL; otherwise as things stand it seems like some teams have caught up with him, while others are hitting and missing with the rest drowning but doing so respectfully."
We are not plastic fans. We die with our team in hard times. We cannot win all games all the time. We are proud of Mancity.
Manchestar rodri
Bailey has that quality.
i can confidently say if city did not have such a great keeper...more goals would have been scored
Props up ederson💪
"Look at how akanji, gvardiol, bernardo, nunes, kovacic, walker get passed so easily and no intention to chase villa players. I fiund it only dias stones ederson who really do their job. Really ashamed. I'm wondering what the use of signing kovacic and nunes? Why dont buy a real good players like wirtz, kvara, musiala, kimmich, or anyone who became top G/A in 2022/2033 season?"
"I like how they've shown us we no longer wanna play good or our mentality not so positive enough to bear in mind that we defending

Bustle up bustle up bustle up City"
Good match
Here Ederson haabate chichi imi Hana dzenyu hadzirove here imi
EDERSON😮
Kaya kebalik statistik nya avl jadi jiwa city dan city kaya avl 😂😂
Emry turning Bailey into the player we saw at Leverkusen...He should've been player of the month for sure!
How is Rodri so important.
Man city trash in game
Rodri
You are right he helps especially in defending
"We really need better defence. And while KDB is gone, there’s no replacement"
Mehrez IS thé best player
Haland un joueur amateur......
"Why are City using white and red colors for this game against a team that is already using red, white and blue as colors? I have not seen the white and red suits before. So little contrast."
"Es evidente que las atajadas del dibu cambiaron el rumbo del partido, el Aston Villa lo pasó por encima al City 🙌"
2 keeper terbaik copa Amerika 🔥
"That kdb comeback is gonna be crazy, and necessary one too"
Where commentator see Alisson😂😂
"What the hell is wrong with city, they've been bad last 3 games. We need de bruyne back bro"
"Congrats to villa, city we will come back stringer."
cmon commentator it's not radio
.
Let’s train hard I wish to join one day but we ain’t going down
We ain’t giving up 🎉
Aston deserve to win....
We may be weak for a while but there is another game and another so let’s go city
Come on city
It is being year to such dominance by any team over city❤
The commentator is awesome. Although if you are on the receiving side he can put you on pressure.
It is a temporary situation
"Now the whole Man city nation will know how painful it feels for other clubs that had been outplayed, beaten and dispossessed flawlessly by Man city. Big credit to Aston villa for this upset and brutal humilation😋"
la atajada del dibu 🥵
Ederson🔥✨
Guardimoñas calbo!
ГУД ИБИНИНГ
ኧረ ሲቲ😂 አይ
What happened to Man city 😳
Good match 👍
"What happened?
Didn't Haaland the Goat play? 😅"
City really missing their midfielders like KDB...
I hate the Rainbow thing on captains hand tho😏
"keep CALM, CITY TILL WE DIE! 💙💙"
Muantulll
Ban capten warna LGBT
😮 unbelievable  perform villa Like emi Martinez
"Now its shame to be City fans,shamless...We missed KDB and rodri so much"
the motivation of the city players was very weak the intire 90 minuet so shamful !
City are lacking in the midfield n the defence garvidol is a natural c.b why play him as a left back . Play kovacic .nunes n rodri in the midfield insted of stones n akanji trying to fill that role
"No rodri,  no de bruyne 😢"
"너무 슬프다 ㅠ
맨시티 시즌 끝까지 화이팅하자 
C.T.I.F."
Aston Villa very well coached good things coming towards the team
"No rodri and KDB ,no MAN City"
"Pep, we don't really like the performance you are giving us and I just read the headline News sports saying you would resign for Man City this season 😢"
Pep Out 😂😂😂
Unai emery and Crazy team transision..
where is your midfielder  kevin
Dibu Martinez quá đỉnh
Unay emery🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿
City need gundogan
Aston villa semakin membaik tetap konsisten ke pertandingan pertandingan selanjutnya
Hahaha hahaha city 😂
"This highlight is a bit biased. It didn't cover all the poor,  incomplete, and back passes of city players which makes the game strange."
Villa bodied city all day long
Im happy for EDDY
And UTD could not score a single goal or a crucial shoot against City
"man city looked tired from this game, i think the players need a break can imagine playing 2 matches a week"
Be interesting watching highlights from a Man C perspective. lol. UTV.
Well played by Aston Villa
"City always struggle when Rodri is not the pitch, well done Villa, deserved win."
"*CAN I PLEASE ASK YOU TO NOT PUT MATCH RESULTS IN THUBMNAIL?* I can't always watch your games live so I watch full match replays instead. It often discourages me from watching those games because when I hop onto YouTube you have posted a highlight video with a thumbnail that shows results. I can't even ""dodge""  your video because they're always the top 5 suggestion on Youtube."
I thought commentator was going to cry😂
"the name of Allah, we invite you to worship Allah alone, so say: I bear witness that there is no god but Allah and I bear witness that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah. These words make you a servant of Allah ....  ......  ......"
City must play rodri galish without they this team very Odínarii
What's happening guys it's so unlike City
Both Goal-Keepers are on 🔥
wkwk defeat'
City are missing the key player🤧
"We need to stop playing players in positions they don't normally play in. We had 6 defenders on the pitch and only created 2 chances.,..🤔 midfield was Villas from kick off."
Ederson is the man of the match
Emi..best GK in the world 🔥
Villa dominating City is not something you see often. Big ups to them for matching City's energy. If Leon just keeps free from injury hell be a force to reckon with this season
"what happened with u guys, c'mon buds this isn’t the City craves for glory"
1-0 Leon Bailey (74 min)
Hehehehehehe
This is beautiful!
"Ma l,,,"
Man City would have lost more than 5 goals to Villa. Thanks to Ederson. Kudos Aston Villa
Это позор!!!
"Dias and Ederson really stepped up that day, Gvardiol was just horrible. Stones just returned from injury, that might counts as an excuse for his horrible game as well.
Rico lewis & Alvarez literally forgot how to play football. 
Also in the January window can we sell Nunes, I reserve my comments for that guy.
In short we were lucky to concede a Goal, a draw wouldn't have been fair to Villa after their performance 😅."
hahaha
"I beg City not to wear rainbow on their captain's sleeves...🙏
So they can continue to win...👍"
"I think I speak for many long suffering Villa fans that this was one of our best performances of the last decade. It wasn’t beating City, it was the way we managed to play football against such a high quality team."
Aston Villa 😮
"City's midfield needs some serious strengthening. It can't rely on Rodri/KDB alone. City's scouts and recruiting should have been signing strong midfielders this summer. They already knew Gundo was leaving and KDB was injured, no excuses."
how do you feel about yourselves after this
good eeeebenin😅
The Man City Defenders were exposing Ederson too much. We really need to correct our mistakes. We need Rodri (defence) & KDB (creativity).
Karma gives us a kick in the leg when we don’t have Rodri…. We need someone who can wonderfully play that Rodri role..
We need something… an inspiration from some where
City was miserable
前に進むだけ！
Эмери уничтожил лысого). На это можно смотреть очень долго
We were miserable
"No Rodri, no party"
Match.
Manchester City goalkeeper was really good even though his team lost 1 - 0
Untung kiper nya bukan onana.. 😅😅
Bro the commentary 😮‍💨
Sadly man city downfall has started with mind games
"Just winning champion league they are weak, how do you compare yourself to real Madrid 😂😮."
"A city fan, but am proud of villa. They taught us serious lesson"
Ederson was really city's Man of the match
Aren’t their jerseys confusing?
Ederson é o único que entrou em campo
What a game! Aston villa!!!! vitality in another level. Kudos! Kudos! Kudos! I will forever remember you as an Arsenal fun.
I'm watching this and I'm like: what's in it for us Arsenal?
"MFC❤
🇮🇳india"
The worst match i see 🤧
"EDERSON 💥🔥🥶
Missing KEVIN 😖😩🥺😣"
We will come back stronger🩵
We will still win the premier league Trophy
Bailey destroyed full city
I've never seen a Pep Guardiola side dominated this much since he joined Epp
We really need to get back to winning ways! 4 games without a win is quite unlike us. Com'on City!!!
Tidak ada yang abadi MANCHESTER CITY
Rodri FC
As a Citizen I am stunned by our lethargy but ALL CREDIT TO VILLA.THEY SHOWED UP
"Rodri now becomes Yaya Toure, no him, no balance in the middle."
At least not 7-0
Damn Aston villa play so good
"Penaldo : ""halland deserves the ballon d'or ?""

At least now they know the difference between Messi and Halland"" 😂"
Leon Bailey
H bhuu😮 4:52 😅 4:54
"CITY LOOKS WEAKER/MEDIOKER n VILLA LOOKS SUPERPOWER/BETTER here, I really don't understand to CITY, DRAW DRAW DRAW LOSE, SO SAD."
Alvarez cannot play cam he does not produce anything
cmon we can get better
thé City attack without KDB and Mahrez is nothing.
I m nkt city fans but Poor guardiola u need up morale from your player and get fire again like last seosen so i can enjoye to wach your game
"# As a Man city fans, let me be just. .. I think villa where better, thanks to Ederson he made some very important saves.. 
Come on city 🏙️,, we can not continue like this 💙⚽🥰🙏## Thanks"
It could be 5-1 lost for man city 😢
2 things. 1. man city wearing the alternate outfit is dumb. 2. Halland threw himself to the ground.
Pep suffering from rodridependencia
"terible defense and ederson carrying this team, we need stones, rodri and kdb so bad"
Dominated 😂😂
"Pep, I beg of you, stop playing 2 strikers without KDB.
I don't know what you are thinking but just stop.
Your defenders are not playmakers..."
Commentator? 🇧🇲
Villa played better than us. But come on CITYYY... let's gooo to the next game.
Goal deflection 😂😂
Manchester is red ♥️
Lol 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Great win 👏👏
If it was arsenal i would have said city playing with arsenal heart again 🤣 but this time its liverpool n hell they are tough
All villa plays well
"in this match Aston Villa like City's Played. so dangerous and 
tactical"
"Pep thinks that Rico Lewis is as good as Evan Ferguson , Lewis Miley or Garnacho"
"Well played and deserved win Villa, we go again we'll be stronger together, come on City💙"
I love city’s youtube channel. They upload the extended highlights even when they lose and are  unbiased unlike some Newcastle united named channel which only upload when they are winning.😂😂😂
"Wish Man City had signed Heungmin Son a few years ago. Sonny has the highest scoring rate.⚽️
[23/24 PL Round 1 - Round 15] 
Son: 35 shots, 9 goals (no PK)
Salah: 44 shots, 10 goals (including 3 PK) 
Haaland: 58 shots, 14 goals (including 3 PK) 
[23/24 Big chances missed]
Son: 1 
Salah: 7
Haaland: 17"
No pasa nada !!! Hermosos!!! ⚽️
"Seeing Ederson’s performance as an Arsenal fan, I’m thinking: If David Raya had been Man City’s goalkeeper, Villa would have won this game 8:0."
halaand had two good chances....
"gvardiol is dog water ngl, what a flop"
I’m surprised you were able to get highlights above 13 seconds
Gracias por todo Diós
This is not Man City that was just Manchester United
Rodri FC 😭😭😭
"haland tidak ada kontribusi, hanya ambisi goal, pantas negara nya tidak pernah lolos eroupa ☺️☺️☺️"
This is the worst I’ve seen city play in a wild 😔
질수도있지 최선을다한선수들💙🩵💙🩵힘내🩵💙🩵💙
"The lack of Rodri is irelevant when individual players aren’t up to standard. Dias, and Ederson are the only ones who were performing somewhat good in my view."
Villa park memberi kejutan
"I'm a city fan but as a person who share the same nation with Leon Bailey, I'm really happy to see them win against such big team like man city, it really takes hard work to make such play."
"ITS ALRIGHTTT, LOOK AT LAST 10 MATCH🔥"
Why are you uploading extended highlights of this game? I am trying to erase it from my memory forever.
Great game from Ederson. His saves were very critical & once again he was beaten by a deflection 🔥
!!!😢😢😢
city got owned.
"I'm so disappointed at city...
They didn't even deserve a draw"
Aston Villa really deserved that win. It takes a lot to beat City.
I miss riyad mahrez the legende
And didn’t show most of the good stuff villa had
i have to admit i miss KDB😢😢😢😢
"Man city. 
💙💙💙"
"your City is red
your City is red
just like Bristol
your City is red"
"Aston villa dominated the game , i felt like they were playing vs blades 😂😂"
Every dog has its own day
More like extended pain
"No Rodri No Man City, all matches lost without the dude!"
Mmezengua nyie😂
"I'm very disappointed in the Blues performance, yall could of done better but nevertheless we'll be bk at the top soon 💪💙💙"
Passing fc vs Aston villa 🎉
Hi
💙💙
What a match for Villa
"Terrible performance by City.
3 draws and 1 defeat in a row is bad, our players need to step up.
Come on man city 💙 🙏 💪"
we miss kdb :(
as a man city fan i think aston villa had a great match. NEVER GIVE UP ❤
Halland is better than Mbappe
Terrible
It was so sad😭😭😭 it won't happen again
"Just Remember Brilliant Save From Ederson. Manchester City Defeat Against Aston Villa In The Villa Park Stadium. 


Commentator : Alistarr Mann & Shaun Gouter."
Always Blue 🔵🔵🔵

Pep is GOAT
Missing KDB😢
