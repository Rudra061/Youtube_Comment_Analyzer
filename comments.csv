"Hi Thoufiq, this is a very impressive tutorial. I followed this and managed to create my own visualizations for my Master of Arts project, which analyzes several political YouTubers' video output. Very helpful!"
"Thank you Thoufiq for the great tutorial. watching in Dec 2023, I guess the API removed the DislaikeCount in statistics and replaced it with FavoriteCount. just a heads-up. I don't know why they did that? Dislikes are good metrics to track specially if we are working with business account on youtube. Thank you again!"

"Hi, It seems the google-api-python-client is not available right now?"
I think your tutorials are amazinggg !! The best data analytics tutorials !! I really like and learn a lot from this tutorial. But I want to work on this code too. The link that you give is not working now. Can you update this link pleeassseee :(((((
"That was wonderfully helpful, Thoufiq. I am a complete novice and while elemets of the coding, such as programs you used, where to find them, how to intergrate are aspects I need to further study, the process you took was clear and inciteful. I paid attention throughout and flatter myself that I saw a few of your return errors before you did üòâ Now to study some more and see where this takes me. Thanks again. David"
Can we get videos based on language like only English videos or only Spanish videos
"Man I'm almost desperate at this point. There's this app called myTube and it's for windows devices. It's a third party YT app and it's friggin awesome but the problem is that the dev is afk, just vanished without any notice. I am quite tech illiterate but I've managed to create my own api key to keep the app going. Lately it wont let me use the embedded palyer whatever that means. Making me use the official YT web player which in turn, won't play anything above 360p, and all of the cool functions of myTube cant be used either. I just wish I knew how to fix this....."

"For those of you who are seeing this project in 2023, in the function to get video ids remove the dislike code as now youtube api does not give information on dislikes."
Great video. Looking for more like this.
"Hey Thoufiq , I'm stuck at 16:45 , the part where I executed the code..........I don't see any output or errors , it just takes me to another line or box to type code..............also the jupyter notebook didn't open in my created environment but I anyways continued in the python ipykernel. Please help me"
how can i get list of channels based on location too and the thumbnail profile photo?
"How do u manage to learn, work, show so much Sir, seems you got dark circles, how do u work so hard pls suggest"
Can I put this project in my resume !!
"30:52 well, now you have 215K subscribers xD Congrats on that, and thanks for the video....!"
"Brilliant tutorial. Appreciated the pace and detail. With this tutorial, I can focus my time on exploring YouTube data and not worrying about how to get it!"
"I was going through the video that has to do with the youtube API
and then I want to take a different way 
I would like to access the number of videos for each of the YouTubers  and also their videos later on as I go on as you did as well"
Clear explanation ‚ù§
"Here's how to get channel ID in 2023:
1. Go to the desired channel and right click on the channel page
2. Go to 'View Page Source'
3. On the source page, top left will have 'Line wrap' with a check box, check that box
4. Press ctrl+F on your keyboard to open search tab
5. Type '?channel_id', it will highlight channel ID for you
6. Copy and use it"
"Project is very awesome for learn but only the thing while speaking take a breath & stop a bit and explain well, continously you are speaking it looks like someone is following you and feeling also sleepy while working on project"
Can we get the github repo for this code?
Now the youtube Channel ID cannot be extracted from the process you mentioned. Please let me know the alternate.
"To those who had problems installing google-api-python-client try these:
To install this package run one of the following:
conda install -c conda-forge google-api-python-client
conda install -c ""conda-forge/label/cf201901"" google-api-python-client
conda install -c ""conda-forge/label/cf202003"" google-api-python-client
conda install -c ""conda-forge/label/gcc7"" google-api-python-client"
That accent is too distracting. You should do some real-time voice cloning to sound like an American. It'll be awesome if it was implemented at the University level 2 so we can understand what these professors are saying.
"This is the first video that I've watched on scraping ANYTHING that I was able to follow from beginning to end, understand, and be able to apply to my own channels and project...without running into problems that couldn't be easily fixed! I could fix my own mistakes because you explained each step so thoroughly.  Thank you!!"
"I am happy I struggled over this. I was googling for a Google Apps script and ended in Python. It is a very clear explanation and I am so happy about your English pronounciation. Lot of your country men(or women) have a strong accent i get very very tired of, so I give up or miss too much. So I subscribed to your channel!"
In Pycharm I'm unable to get the return response. The code is executed perfectly but with no output in the console. What to do?

"Can we also extract random channel names/IDs using python code for the data analysis to know who's at the top in any field? 
We have to search the channel name to find its id as of now. I had to search google for the top subscribers and then analyzed it. Can't we just randomly sample this whole youtube dataset to get the channel and do the analysis?"
thank you so much for this ! it was super easy to follow along you are a great teacher!
can someone tell me how to scrape the duration of the video??
can't we use pycharm?
