"Loving the feedback! Also NOTE: Spatial video can be shot by iPhone 15 Pro/Pro Max only, not by the regular 15, I misspoke at 7:13 - Apple apparently didn't align the cameras for the regular 15."
😤BARCELONA 🔵🔴
What a flex!
Was this the pro or pro max being shown?
I always thought that if one day Marques came out with a shirt it would be the Real Madrid one.😅
Sheep video
That 911 is soooo firreeee
"I just think, why upgrade if your phone still works? I was watching videos the other day from a phone I had two phones ago, and they looked darn good. We've become a throw-away society, a consumer driven society. We don't live in a world where all the resources will last forever. We must stop thinking like that. By the way, you should be an Apple salesman if you aren't already. Unless you're already getting perks."
This video is really about Marques’ confession on the 911. Congratulations mate 👏
2:10 My Samsung had this feature (zoom in and crop) for quite a time.
Goodnight Samsung
Test comments
Visca el Barça!!!!😬
So the 15 pro is now a Red Hydrogen One ? Lol
"3:24 ""Since, I never use siri""

Really? 😮"
That end was so good!! Goosebumps idky
Was this an apple sponsored video? Or maybe the deal was you do this video and that 911 is yours 😊
Goated jersey
"I bought it coming from an iPhone X. What impressed me the most, apart from the camera, are the speakers! Like damn I wasn’t expecting that!"
"Upgraded from the 13 Mini, it’s really heavy compared to the Mini for obvious reasons. However the performance and battery life is amazing. I do miss the minis form factor however"
The Barca kit🔥
Ditched the Tesla for a 911? Smart move. Charging is a pain. Petrol is always available.
visca barca!
just also recently learned you can swipe left on the lock screen to go to camera... which apaprently was there forever? hahaha
Love the T-Shirt
marques i swear your videos get better and better evry time i watch one!
"I've had my S22 U without a case for 2 years, it's been fine although I've used a plastic thin screen protector."
"Bring the option of ""audio track"" in your videos.
Specially Hindi language"
To be fair I didn’t even tell he shot the video the 15
hey keep up the good work on making entertaining videos i wish i could do that but i was wondering if you were to see this what are your thoughts on the voice calling ability that we now have with chatgpt i was asking it question for fun and talking to it and forgot that it was an ai on the other side of the call.
Please share what site those orange and blue cases are from friend.
OK be real? Any issue of over heating or battery swelling?
"Hey mkbhd, i think the screen was not as tough as iphone X AND XS screens, the 15 pro / max can easily be scratched. Right?"
Cool video but I always hoped you would be a Real Madrid supporter 😂😂
should i upgrade to an iPhone 15 pro? (I have a 5s)
I still have issues with overheating but the phone is good
Bad shirt tbh HALA MADRID ⚪️⚪️⚪️⚪️⚪️⚪️⚪️⚪️
"9:26 is a flex till the end i love it, really nice car!"
Was audio captured on 15 pro as well?
I think my iPhone 8 with 78% battery health got a few more good years in it 💀
"I knew something was up, the video looked like it was refined by AI A LOT but not bad"
That weather widget/screen saver you’re using? What is it?
"Hey Marques,
Where do you get your wallpapers?"
Happy birthday Marques!
I use the action button for the yubico app.
Wow the video looks great.
Last sentence was a great surprise. Wow that is good .
Switching from the 13 pro max to the 15 pro was well worth the upgrade
literally anyone can make youtube videos nowadays on an iphone!
Barca shirt tho? 🤮
🎥 📱🔥
"Almost, so close on been one of the best videos, a winning video😎... Except for you choice of attire🙅‍♂.... The Barcelona shirt 🤦‍♂
Hala Madrid.😜"
What was that weather app @ 6:26
"Can a reviewer please be honest about how bad the front facing camera on the pros are for a $1500+ iphone? There are whole apple forums and Reddit threads about this and Apple has done nothing to fix it!!!!! Not only that, they need to put fingerprint sensors back in their phones. I’ve had to unlock my phone with the passcode because the face scanner frequently cant read my face. I’m coming from Samsung to Apple and after this I would never recommend or buy an Apple phone again! There’s so many issues to list, but a front facing camera is unacceptable."
Okay I understand comparing the iPhone to the 911 but they’re not. Porsche actually cares about their customers not like Apple who will try to screw you over
I still have the 12 Pro Max there is not a reason to get a new phone
Take that jersey off
01:24 onwards there is background static noise (hissing sound) in this video
iPhone screen scratches so much more than Pixel. Get your crap together apple
Barca sucks get Real Madrid jersey .. the winner circle . Hala Madrid
"switched to the iphone 15 pro, base model, from pixel 7. while i'll always miss the universal back button, my experience so far has been mostly great, besides the move to ios app being awful."
"Nice video, like usual. Which weather’s app use for that cool widget? 6:25"
"Sounds like Porsche and Apple had a talk with Marques!! 😂

911 is like a horse carriage these days, and the reasons to upgrade to the new iPhone are just rediculous! I miss the days when youtubers were honest in their reviews and not puppets in big mastodont tech circusses!!"
"while this phone offers so many good features, I think its one of the cheapest apple made. I have had the iphone 14 pro max and switched to the 15 pro, right away I noticed that my network signal is awful, it heats quickly, battery runs fast, and the touch screen is not very accurate. I have had the iphone 14 pro max for almost a year and I cant remember it ever heating! I love the new features but gotta say, they saved up some money on this one."
Why is there a different dog! :o
"Marquez literally jumped on us the way apple did 

Though I’m spooked although I did notice a slight change in video quality but I wasn’t much centered on it though ❤❤"
Living his best life
This video was clearly sponsored by apple 😅 never mentioned the heat problem
"@mkbhd Love your story telling and naration build to 911 Turbo, just magic! Marques, your body language and facial expression gave away that you are not overly happy with your choice on the Titanium colour 1:25  , will you choose the black colour instead? Congratulations on the 911 Turbo, great taste and style!"
Marques is a Barca fan?
Why is Apple taking so long to update the AirPods Max?
Now send me one.😂
❤ Just for wearing Barcelona shirt
¡Barcelona!
I have the natural titanium 15 pro max and I refuse to ever use a case or screen protector. Always have. Got a small scratch so far. Dropped once.
The Barca jersey ❤💙❤💙❤💙
"why 88 day?
judt use it for 2 days more and avoid the nazi numbers man"
"This guy will be the next ceo for apple, 😅  my goodness to end 2023 a big advertising video for the 15 pro...By the way the 911 is a german European car, DO NOT LINK THIS MASTER PIECE TO ANY 🍏 PRODUCT !!! this is an insult 😮"
"You forgot to put.. This video is sponsored by apple cuz obviously you are payed to say this. Iphone 15 is trash.
Sent from Samsung Galaxy s20 ultra mega giga CHAD"
I didn’t know MKBHD is also Barça fan😄
Watched this video last night and decided to upgrade my 12 Pro to the 15 Pro. Loving it 😊
"I had to send my 15 pro back because of terrible battery life, an aspect you didn’t touch my man"
Interesting move going from a tesla to a turbo s… i’m sure you are loving it even more and it better be worth it considering it cost almost doble!
i actually had some regrets after upgrading from 11pm to 15pro but you made me feel better in this vid 😊
Barca jersey ? Eyuw!
"Hi brownlee, Can you gift me an iPhone please?"
waaaaa
Bro why are you always wearing Barcelona jersey but not Real Madrid 🤔
"Did this guy just say, that porsche 911 is boring?"
"action button placement is a weird one. Its actually perfectly placed for your thumb if you're left handed which is fine for me. but it is so horrendously out of place for right handed people. i wonder if Apple actually wanted to put it where the volume down button is, but couldnt because they didn't go for the solid state buttons this year as this would have allowed for those buttons to easily be mapped to whatever they wanted"
"After using the iPhone 15 Pro for a month, two things bug me: 
First the battery life when under medium to high load is not very impressive, compared to other phones. In fact it is a bit worrying if you plan on using the phone for several years. With battery degradation and OS updates it can only get worse. 

Then, the action button, I hate it. I mistake it for volume ALL the time. And if you want to use it as a camera shutter, you have to hold the phone ""upside down"", so the lens sits at the bottom, I don't know anyone that holds his phone like that naturally. Also it requires such a hard press, that you slightly move the phone, which is not ideal. I would have been happier if they just removed the button completely."
Where’s the blind camera test?
"Studio channel video incoming on ""How we shot entire video with an iPhone""? :)"
Marques’s arms must be huge with all that flexing.
"I’ve found the action button on the iPhone 15 Pro to be an exceptional tool for quick and stealthy operations, especially useful during work hours and meetings. For tasks like recording voice memos during work, it’s incredibly efficient. After work, I often use it for swiftly accessing ChatGPT, or another app when my needs change. Another feature that’s remarkably handy, yet often overlooked, is the Back Tap function. With this, you can choose from one of the 35 shortcuts using either a double or triple tap action, which significantly broadens the phone’s ease of use and adaptability."
That explains the bad audio quality
Barca para siempre❤ 💙 !!
Drop the shirt
Why the Barcelona shirt?
What’s the app at 06:27 ?
How’s your weather app look like that and mine look like the old one.
I was wondering why the exposure was kinda off in the opening shot
I use my action button for the flashlight
"Belated happy birthday, Marques!"
"Notice how the entire video was about camera features. 
When will iphones be able to splitscreen multitask?"
Casually flexing his self gifted Matt Black 911 at the end. 🥶💥❤‍🔥
Barca fans hands up.!🤍🤍
Can you do one for the iPhone 15 pro max or does this video compensate it?
4:30 People still forget that you can simply swipe left to open the camera from the lock screen... 🫠
7:34 what about the people whose eyes are on top of each other ? another low blow from Apple
"You can swipe left from the home screen to access your camera, that’s faster than pushing a button"
Happy watching this on my 15 Pro!
"My wife uses a galaxy S22 and I recently got the 15 pro max, and MAN is it wonderful that we can use the same cables now."
"Does iPhone picture quality starts degrading after 3 months?
Plz make a video on it"
There's white noise in the video. annoying
How can I use google assistant with iPhone ?
"Never saw you buying as pretentious of a car as a Porsche.

And, 14 Pro is the worst iPhone I’ve owned out of the 9 I’ve had. Should’ve waited a year but two years is the max I can go. Unfortunately the 14 Pro is no faster than the 13 it replaced."
The jersey❤
That smirk of a smile at the end...
"Saying ""The Porsche 911 is not flashy"" should instantly summon representatives of the local workers' council to expropriate all your wealth."
Why didn’t you shoot or upload in HDR?
6:12 he has the new air pods. He keeps looking to his left like he has them.
"Great review. Been using the 15 pro max from November and loving the black color. A hot take, as a left handed guy, I am loving the placement of the action button but I'm not using for anything hardcore or new and flashy, just the plain old mute toggle."
Nice turbo man.
Subtle flex but ok😜
The new action button does nothing for me. I miss the old switch button that goes into silent mode. More satisfying to use too.
Hi Love
"bro, HALA MADRID"
still junk in my little eyes
Should do this video for the Pixel 8. And also shoot that with that device
Your racist towards android
Your payed by apple dude
Flex on Flex
My action button does pause and play for audio! Rather than having to return to an app or go to control center i just hit the button.
"Superb review. Well paced, articulate, succinct, informative, audio & video quality top notch. You saved me a bunch of time. Your review was my first hit from my search results. No need to look any further. You answered everything I needed to know. Many thanks."
"Apple will take its time to switch all its accessories to USB-C until it finds a way to monetize those accessories, or recoup the potential money lost some other way. Now if a major governing body enforces a switch and there is no way to go around it like USB-C on the iPhone, then that’s another possibility. 😎"
If you want camera button on the side then you can have Sony Xperia 😂
Barca😂
"Although it is impressive that the video was fully shot on the i-phone,  I was wondering most of the time why there was so much ""smoothing"" around the face and skill in general, its very different from your other videos.  but nice."
"Hi give me your honest advise, i an an enterproner, i need only productivity   should i have an iphone or samsunf z fild ??"
That had to be the best mic drop in a long time
The video is damn good.. iPhone videography is miles apart from Samsung and Google
"iPhone is still king in my books but the 15 Pro takes the cake for my least favourite design. Apple can hype that boring beige phone all they want, but it's a boring beige phone. I'd like to see them readopt the contrasted design of the black iPhone 4 and 4S...After shopping a mockup of the 15 Pro in a rich emerald green I came to the conclusion I'd skip this series to see what the 16 Pro brings to the table, and with rumours of the Pro and Pro Max getting a slight bump in display size, I'm more than happy to wait."
"Man, the last line was awesome! It shows the transition of MkBhd as a whole."
Barcelona???
What’s the weather app on his phone
"The high top fro been there a minute now, hoping to see some braids sometime next year"
I'm still rocking my 13 Pro and probably won't get rid of it for a while.  I got the 256GB version so I have plenty of storage and the USB-C isn't compelling enough for me.  I only use the port for CarPlay...everything else is wireless charging/headphones.  Awesome Porsche by the way!! Jealous over here..lol
"Do what I do. Get yourself a type-C female to Lightning shorty cable - I also have one for micro-B. Good ones are unfortunately hard to search for, and you definitely don't want the solid ones that are easy to find. Either way though, the end result is having no need for a cable other than type-C."
"What I don’t understand all these people talking about about the other features in the action button is… HOW DO YOU SILENCE YOUR PHONE??? do you actually pull out your phone and scroll through to the menu when you’re, say, in a dark theater or during a date and you can’t remember if you silenced your phone?? Baffles me"
Wait wait wait…and I hate that I’m gonna say this on such a huge platform because it’s something I’ve been plottin on…but was it shot with spacial video too!?
That humble flex was LEGENDARY! Happy Birthday Marcus! Thanks for the inspiration -ThatKidWayne
"Wow, this went from a review to feeling like a show off quickly. But anyway still enjoy his videos, hope he continues to make more."
"Maybe unpopular opinion, but stainless steel looks much better for me."
Did Apple pay you to shoot this on an iPhone?
Mr 2phones😂
"Still rocking the iPhone SE, iPad 10th Gen now, and the M1 Macbook Air. Does more than what I need for the baseline price."
If only the vision pro played all the steam and oculus games it would be worth it
Hala Madrid ❤️
Why do you use your middle finger to press the action button or is it just me that noticed it... Wouldn't the index be much easier? just an observation
"Why the barca shirt man, real Madrid shirt suites youre profile man"
The main talking head shot looks fantastic and shows the capabilities of iPhone video at their best. However shots like 4:50 show that it's not time to get rid of our bigger more expensive cameras just yet.
This is the best video ever
"Congratulations, Marques. You have earned it"
0:11 Visca El Barca
Not a car guy buys the most not a car guy 911. The Porsche 911 Turbo (automatic transmission) is for the wealthy gentleman that can't drive.
Every person on YouTube talks about all the latest and greatest features on a as far as brightness clarity and a bunch of stuff that's useful to some but it's people that work out in the middle or nowhere and are here 1 day and over there the next. We are looking for phones with the best reception or who has the best coverage for someone that is all over the US working. I can't seam to find a YouTube video with any of that on it.
That subtle peak design backpack drop thou. ❤
What was that wallpaper!!?? Anybody know?!
did you filmed this video with anamorphic lens? OMG
"I’m a Porsche man as well. I think that was a GREAT choice for you. I’m happy to see you’re enjoying what your hard work is earning. I’m also happy to see you’re aging and maturing like wine. Great review, like always."
10:10 no wayyyy 😯
30 seconds in and I can tell this was shot on a phone. Checked the comments and bingo!
my airpods that i got for christmas are USB-C??
They should at a screenshot feature to the Action Button. Right now it's only available through Shortcuts and even then it's very hard (impossible) to find the screenshotted image.
"I wish they’d finally add in multiple press options to the action button. 

That way you could set a hold, double press and triple press action. Would make the button more useful"
Fire jersey
Bro you look like Alphonso Davies from Bayern Munchen so take off that barca jersey 😂😂
Marquez take that jersey off! Hala Madrid
I still can't believe that this was shot on iPhone 15 pro😮
Your battery health and cycle count after 88 days? @mkbhd
congrats on the car !
I've set my Action Button to... mute/unmute. It's the thing I do more frequently (thanks to needing to unmute in order to hear sound in games on iPhone!).
"I turned 30 in two years. If I wasn’t such such a fucking bum, I’d be able to buy myself a 911."
"No offense,  but Apple is not as good as Android. Watching from my Tab S9 Ultra 5G 512GB expandable storage with calcuator"
"4 months later ..,.5 months later.,,.,,"
"Been waiting for this moment for a long time, phone reviews shot on camera of review. You and iphone 15 have my respect! :)"
What weather app are you using?
whassup wit the fucking battery of this iphoen 15 pro? my shit is ass
Didn't know Marques is a Barca fan!
Barca fans haven't taken off the jersey since the Girona game 😂
"You wearing a Barca jersey dropped my jaw, HALA MADRID💯. Appreciate your video tho"
"6s user here. Do you guys think Apple will add even more action buttons for iphone 16? That button seems like for the first time the legit reason to switch phones. If iphone 16 has one more of this custom button, I will buy it."
Thank you Europe 😅
Wondering what that weather app was…kinda like the subdued appearance.
"I think I’ve pressed the action button on my phone about 3 times, and 2 of those were right after setting it up on day one."
Samsung is better
Why does your weather app looks different?
Have been using my samsung note 10 for 3 years now wish i can get a new iphone 15 pro as a gift😢😢
"Definitely  getting this phone soon, I've been on X since release and haven't seen much need to upgrade, thought about the 14 pro but kinda forgot about it lol, but I am in love with the 15 pro and it is a must upgrade for me."
Happy birthday Marques🎉🎊
Wish you were in another shirt
There is nothing exciting about current phones
"I see iPhone, I click. Simple as that. The phone created by the Almighty Creator himself. Anyone who doesn't own one is a heretic and deserves eternal damnation."
Happy late birthday Mkbhd!
Nice Shirt👌
"I love the insights you gave for a longer time period with the phone. I find myself more and more curious about iPhones as time goes by. I also love the callback to the apple presentations of old ""shot on the iPhone"" scenario."
Where can i get the wallpaper he has on his iphone?
"Bug or fun fact? If you take a spatial video, it won’t open up on an older iPhone when you send it."
"And yet my 2019 Samsung Galaxy S10 has a easy to reach action button for any app I choose, Google assistant immediately available anytime just by long pressing the home button, and my camera always at my fingertips just by double tapping my on/off button. I even have magic eraser on my camera app that somehow with all the tech, Apple still can't do? When will Apple people learn that their ""innovative features""  are still subpar to Android features from 5 years ago? With my 5 year old Samsung, I'm jealous of the iPhone 15 Pro screen, facial recognition (my fingerprint reader behind the screen is honestly terrible), processor and titanium sides, but nothing else. Thanks for the update video!"
No way iphone shot mkbhd video 😢 i am missing alot. I love iphone
Saga phone is way better . Can't buy bc it's sold out. This channel is a joke. Apple favoritism.
Request for Doug Demuro collab! 💪
9:03  is that the reflection of an iphone 15 pro?
What weather app is that?
Happy birthday bro 🎉🎉🎉
U look good in a Barca shirt
Love the word ANNOYING synch well with iPhone. 😅😅😅😅😅
Can we get a review on that Porsche 911?
Will you please give us a link for that wallpaper?
Oneday i will buy an iphone for me.😢😊
"I thought that they made the iPhone 15 mini. But no, Marques just has big hands."
Waiting for the same video about pixel 8 pro :)
The casual custom peak design backpack flex is wild
I wish I would’ve waited longer to get the 15
5:13 You said thank you Europe (for iPhones now having USB-C). It was not Europe but because of EU. Europe not same as EU
Happy birthday Marques.
Man that looks so tiny on your hand
"Fucking love the shirt Marques, VISCA BARCA ❤💙"
I don’t believe you exaggerated how useful Apple features would be you never do this……
love the action button. what if they did a second action button on top of the phone like where the old power button used to be? or is that doing too much lol
"Well, upgrading from the 6s, it has been a good decision in my opinion. I think out of the last three generations, this was the better option."
yes  ok
""
"What is the name of the weather app , it looks very cool"
Dude… that 911 Turbo ❤️
God damn that car is so beautiful. I hate not being rich. LOL
Battery percentage after 3 months…
I totally agree. I have the 15 pro max and I recently told a friend that I’m not going to upgrade for a couple years because I feel as though this iPhone is the sweet spot for iPhone models.
so i think expensive equipments is no longer need if your not a professional. we're in the boundary of breaking the wall or not.
"I just want to see the goggles, that’s the only thing I’m interested in from Apple"
"Tbh, I’m a bit disappointed, and I’m a fan of Apple

I upgraded from an iPhone X (because it’d been outmoded) to the 15 Pro (not max) about 1.5 months ago, and while I felt like my last phone was suffering from the touch-disease, I don’t feel this one is that much more responsive. Better, yes, but still lacks the snappiness I remember early on in iPhone life

Also, I find that it just can’t scan smaller QR or UPC codes - it’s like it can’t get the focus right, and most apps don’t seem to have the programming in to recognize that the phone has other more useful focal lengths that could (and often should) be used

Battery life is a bit better too, but not overwhelmingly so (maybe 10-20% better?)"
"galaxy s24 series coming soon, wondering how Exynos 2400 will perform!"
"Marques: “It’s like the Porsche 911: boring, predictable.”

Me, driving the 2003 Camry I inherited from my grandma: yeah bro, totally"
"Love the video and well done on the new 911, well deserved."
0:26 please use red
You liked your backpack.. please share the name
"Damn, i dun even notice the quality of the video of iphone 15 pro..."
I wish I was rich enough to think a Porsche is boring 😂
Why does your iphone 15 pro have the 5g cutout on the frame below the power button and mine doesn‘t? 🤔 10:01
Happy belated birthday
"@5:00 ipPro without a case, held like that, on the stairs!!"
How much your battery health for 3 month using
"You're an inspiration! Great video, you will always be my favorite tech YouTuber. 🤝"
Like cause of the T-Shirt 😍😍😍😍
You definitely drop my phone a hell of a lot less than me.
What a surprise to see you in the Barça outfit. Greetings from Barcelona! 😬😊 Nice review
BATTERY HEATING UP ISSUE -  Disappointed that you mentioned that this issue has been fixed when there are endless iPhone 15 Pro users on many forums including Apple that have not fixed issue on iOS 17.2 or 17.2.1. (Mine included 15 Pro) Please shed some light as would help so many frustrated users who do t feel like there are being listened to. Thanks  Marques 😎✌🏻
"Great upgrades from the previous iPhones and congrats on the car. I was excited for this phone, but if I knew the battery was going to be trash, I would have stayed with the 14 ProMax. Everyone on YouTube seems to be skipping over this trash battery life and just ignore it."
"I was wondering why the focus was all weird at around 0:32, guess that's why"
"Congratulations on the Porsche! Beautiful and classic! Also woooo, 30 club! :) Great video as usual. Thanks Marques!"
Barcelona Shirt!!! Oh yeah!!❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
6:46 iPhone seems so old and nothing about it innovative! That flat screen looks like completely out of time! Apple scamming her customers!
Could you do a video on the newest battery tech
Congratssss❤❤❤❤❤
I don't know why choose to pick iPhone 15 pro rather than 15 pro max!!!??
"This entire comment, every single word was written on an iPhone 15 Pro."
Visca barca
5:54  okay whats that backpack 👀👀
MKBHD in a Barca Kit. Seen everything for this year.
15 or 15 pro?
Bring back messages/text pop up’s !!!! From iPhone 4😊
Can you send me this one... If you are now not using mote
Using it since first sale day. Great phone!
"للأسف، طلع برشلوني 😅
المشكلة فيديوهاته تعجبني.


بتغاضى عنه هالمرة، فرصة اخيرة..😂"
"Upgraded from a 12Pro to a 15Pro Max… mainly for battery life and I have zero regurts. Size disappeared within days, zero battery thoughts, 120hz makes it feel so smooth."
"This is the reason as to why ""camera tests"" should always include video."
"wow, i'm proud of myself. i figured out it was shot on iPhone."
freakin sexy car man
The screen of my 15 pro got more scratches in 3 months then my galaxy s22 got in 2 years
"i haven't watched this video yet but I know it will be full of  appreciation. Action button is there for a lot of phone, all the software features are there in a lot of phone and iPhone 15 breaking like anything. Still Marques will find ways to appreciate it. 😂😊"
14+ years of YouTube grind to get to the 911. Congrats!
"Here come android users frothing at the mouth, in a conversation that doesnt involve them, because someone likes a phone that isnt android"
"i got a iphone 15 pro blue titanium recently, and I still havent used it since, i am waiting for my screen protector and phone case"
Who else saw the dog in the background
"Happy birthday and congrats on the new batmobile 911! Well deserved! I agree with your point about Porsches. They're like Apple in many ways, they don't go for the most horsepower, or try to be first with the latest tech. They just refine everything really well. I have a Porsche Cayenne GTS and every inch of it is designed flawlessly."
nice epic end hehe
Its strange that even after these so called scratch resistance glass like gorilla glass and ceramic shield they still manage to get deep scratches! And if we need to use a screen protector anyway then what's the meaning of using these scratch resistance screen to begin with? Something to think about and also question the companies too.i guess the old HTC sapphire glass needs to come back.
Mac Studio x Windows Wallpaper. They are comin' for ya
Marques making a video on Formula 1 and wearing a Barca jersey was not on my 2023 bingo card!
That action button should've been on iphone long ago. Maybe it just me and my clinical skill issues because I cannot use the mute switch with a case on.
Is that Jarvis behind you
Barcelona t shirt whhhyyyy??
I was wondering if with that spacial video you could capture in a certain aspect ration that lets you choose between vertical or horizontal format without losing resolution like the 4:3 10bit 6k new lumix are able to do
Happy birthday fam! And wait… he shot the entire review on the 15 Pro?!?
This video was not shot on iPhone
Fc Barcelona💙❤️
u got me with that last part - shot on iphone 15 pro... damn thats a good camera!
"18s in and I can almost immediately tell this is not shot with a real camera. Assuming there's going to be a ""this was shot on the iPhone, could you tell?"" moment later 😂

Edit: called it."
how about your battery CycleCount and Battery Health?
What is the name of that !weather app?
A barca shirt ugh🤮🤮
"I regret going from 13 Pro to 15 Pro. Battery life is over half worse, nothing so new what i need. Really wasn't worth it. I'm thinking about selling it."
Nice FCB t-shirt! :)
Can someone tell what that weather app is ?
Wait nothing about battery? Cmong
The mic gave it away... I was listening to this on my earbuds and the humming noise was loud enough to notice something was off!
“More nicer” 🤦‍♂️
"I initially thought this video was shot on a Red camera, like you usually use. I didn't even notice it was shot on an iPhone. Woah!"
"I think iPhone reviewers should adopt a new metric for new iPhones: Recommended Upgrade. What's the latest model of iPhone for which an upgrade to the newest one is worth it? For a game changing update, it might even be last year's model. For a super incremental bump, it might be 3 or more model years ago. 

To use the 15 as an example...given the same trim level, is upgrading from the 14 worth it (lol)? From the 13? Possibly. Definitely going 12->15 would be a significant jump."
You’re 6M Subs away to beat apple 🙀
MKBHD's standard video quality is so high that even something as stellar as this stands out as an anamoly. You could immediately tell that this video is not up to the quality of the rest. Insane.
..hear the  Master..
911 video coming soon?
"Somehow, after seeing the color representation of MKBHD’s skin tone, I knew at once that this video was shot using the iPhone 15pro 😊"
Matte Black Porsche 911: Paragon of boring and not flashy
4:28 I think the fastest for the camera is on the Lock Screen and swipe left (apart from the action button)
lol says having more time with a Vision Pro is a flex then shows new 911 and calls it boring.
Nice jersey 😮
Happy you are a Barca fan 😂😂
Wholet my man use a Barca jersey?
The whole video was him just waiting to say that last line at the end xD
Can you please talk about what’s going on with the Apple Watch being unavailable?
"The longer term reviews are awesome, I typically don’t buy until a few months later so it’s very helpful to have an actual real world use case. See what hype feature works and what might not. Cheers."
REALLL MADRIDDDDD BOOO BARCA BOOOOO
Congrats on the 911!! 😮🎉
i had an iPhone XR. upgraded to 15 pro max. I guess it was a good decision
I've never understood how credit card plastic can scratch a screen made of gorilla glass.
The plot twist of everything being film on a iPhone 15pro is so insane
Does anyone has battery drain issue with pro?
Is this video shot on a phone ?
"I am not an apple product person. I am not invested in their environment. The one thing i do have to say though is that apple has definitely got you guys hooked. I don't mean that in a bad way just a truthful way. That being said, I watched this video and noticed it was very camera focused (no pun intended) i am not a camera person. Cameras don't mean anything to me. I don't think I've taken 100 pictures in the three years I've owned my phone. If i want to take pictures or video i use an actual camera and i don't want a phone for that. So why is it so important to reviewers? I do like that you left the recording reveal to the end of the video though. Thanks for another insightful commentary. Be blessed"
Insanely good video quality for a phone. Leagues ahead of its competition. Good work man.
As a creator that (also) uses iPhones as cameras the USB-C was a game changer for me and I living being able to record directly to a SSD while also using the DJI mic at the same time.
"Hey @mkbhd

I just wanted to express my sincere admiration for your incredible work. As a fan from East Africa, Tanzania, your videos have been an inspiration to me, especially as I embark on creating content from this beautiful part of the world.

I've never owned an iPhone before, and I'm eager to explore its capabilities in my video productions. If it's not too much to ask, would it be possible for you to consider gifting the iPhone you've already reviewed? It would mean the world to me and significantly aid in improving the quality of the content I wish to create.

Regardless of your decision, I'll continue to support and appreciate your content. Your dedication to tech and your community has been truly impactful. Thank you for being an inspiration!🤘"
You can also slide lookscreen from right to left to open camera.
Spacial videos has no chance to look good with that little distance between cameras.
I’ll just keep my iPhone 13 Pro Max for at least another year. Started renovating my own house so didn’t have the money to spend on a expensive phone. First thing I probably will upgrade is my smartwatch as my first galaxy watch is now almost 5 years old and doesn’t work that great with my iPhone.
I like how the YT top comments can now easily manipulated. I also like how there’s no mention of battery life.
"I want to see those spatial videos on my old Nintendo 3ds
Or maybe it's a better idea to watch my old Nintendo 3D videos on the Apple headset, that would be cool"
Damnnn the cinematography
That barca shirt fit you so well
the worst thing about this phone is that it forces u to buy a phone cover cuz its so badly designed. u have to keep it face down
Sponsored by apple 🍎
Love the phone specially the shirt!
M always mentions fingerprints and it's not something that has ever been a thing for me 😬
No information about battery life ??
Happy Birthday Marques🥳
s23 ultra is better in every  single way
"Bloopers
Apple CEO - Tim Cook requested for this video"
Would love to see your maximum capacity for the battery on one of these long term reviews of yours. It feels like every iPhone I've used within the last 3 years has degraded too fast and I'd like to see your charging habits.
this guy took birth to enjoy every single thing available on this planet
Or is waiting for the 16 series a better choice seeing as it will be the second gen?
You say that we can record spatial video only in iphone 15 and 15 pro because the camera  adjustments they are in line but in iphone 15 they are diagonal?
"I upgraded to the 15 pro max from my 11 pro max and it’s a world of difference for sure . The 11 pro max didn’t feel like a pro max . But the 15 pro max lives up to its name , everything about it feels so premium . Especially the camera settings with the raw photos"
"setting what my action button would do has been a challenge personally and thus far, I've decided to not do anything with it yet till i find what's useful. For the whole camera easy access, i just swipe left on my home screen (i do not know if people do not know that.... was doing that on my 11 Pro i had for almost 4 years till i switched to the 15 Pro) hence why i have not set my action button to the camera app."
"Waoh, it's been a long time since I saw that wallpaper."
wait the whole video was shot on the iphone 15 did he meant to say that??????
can't anyone else hear this annoying fan noise in his videos? I might be going crazy :/
Shot on iPhone 15 pro 👀
mine’s glitchy
"Loved the Jersey 💙❤️
Visca El Barca y Visca El Catalunya"
Me from Europe: Your welcome!
"Kudos, also not a hater but I knew the video was somehow not like your regular camera videos...it's kind of tint overlay on it...anyways nice job"
Y'all notice how apple and mkbhd don't talk about the pro max. All of a sudden he prefers the pro over the pro max
for opening camera you can also swipe left on the lock screen if you don't fancy pressing the camera button
"my biggest gripes - poor battery life, and the titanium heats up!"
"congrats on the new 911, superb gift to get yourself at 30. Absolutely amazing video and great ending!"
Thanks
"AFter he said this review was filmed using the iPhone, I had to rewatch, whoelse?"
"I like how you dicriminate with the same word ""boring same design"" while reviewing different phone examples, such as Samsung and this iPhone"
Please do this with pixel 8 pro too
"Action button to open the camera? You can just swipe left on the lock screen anyway…. Happy Birthday, btw! 😀"
Halamadrid
I don’t see much difference between my 13pro and 15pro am I missing something
"Just like mkbhd's videos. It's not flashy, it's not new, it's familiar. Confidence inspiring."
What is the weather App you’re using please?
"Bro always won't tell about negatives. Im using 15 pro Max its getting over heat when camera is on also for long general usage. Also few bugs are there. Always Don't believe the top youtubers they won't care for the people ,they always stands for brands side."
"Came here for the iPhone 15 Pro, but the biggest smile came because of the 911. Nice, hope you enjoy it!"
FC Barcelona yeah
Congrats on the 911! You do not need to upgrade them in a hurry either! They satisfy for decades! Also 30’s are fun as are 40’s and 50’s!
Was this shot in apple pro res or regular settings?
Upgraded from an iPhone 6s Plus which I have been using for almost 8 years. The difference is insane
why bsrcelona ?
Ik im not the only one that did this with the action button but I use it as shortcut to play my playlist😂
"There’s something about the 15 Pro that feels ‘right’.  Ok, I have the 15 Pro Max, however I think maybe it finally feels complete? The 12 stared the journey and the 15 shows how it should be?"
"Ain't strange that Apple rebirths existing tech and gives them new names - spatial video. I am a 3D movie fan and that sounds same as spatial video. The wrap up statements about Porches and iPhones, it is their design language and very key for car brands"
30 secs in and I can already tell its shot from an iPhone.
I love the jersey
Hala Madrid 🥲
Do no upgrade guys- this bullshit need to be stopped
Love to see more longer term reviews
Visca Barca 😊
"You can do so much more with the action button, those presets are just scraping the surface"
"10:10 GET OUTTA HERE!!! 😳😳 I have an iPhone 15 pro, that's pretty impressive cuz I can't shoot a video like this. Were your camera settings set on default?"
My experience with the 15 pro max over the last 3 months the has been 1500 dollars of straight bullshit. I just make called text watch YouTube. Wanted a bigger battery than the 13 pro max and a single charging cord for everything. You win some you loose some. This one I lost.
"Great video Marques (love the more longer term reviews 👍). The 15 pro is awesome, but not worth the extra €260 (!!) to me. You’re helping Apple make people climb the marketing latter and making even more 💸"
"Yikes!! I deserve New Iphone this comin’ New Year, from XsMax to 15pro max 🙏"
I was about ask what this was shot on cause it looked a bit different and in the end you said it.  Congrats on the car
"Great video, what is the weather widget on your phone?"
Now that's The Review.
how do it make my settings pitch black just like his??
Yea my Porsche 911 is also not flashy
this entire video is worth it for the end
Me parece demasiado random que use una camiseta del barça lol.
"It was shot on iPhone alright...
But was it a spacial video for the Vision thought 🤔🤔🤔?
Great video Marques, you got me watching Apple products videos, even though I'm a Android guy.
And that's your strong feature."
What about the overheating? I think even after all the software updates my 15 pro max still overheats during a video call or updating apps etc. My iphone 12 on the other hand just warms up little bit doing exact same things. It may be something wrong with hardware design of 15 pro max.
Now I can let go my iPhone 7 😆
Just upgraded to 15 pro max yesterday from s10
ME DUELEN LOS OJOS DE VERTE  VESTIDO CON LA CAMISETA DEL CLUB MÁS CORRUPTO DEL PLANETA!!!! ☹️
The video was a tiny bit over exposed I knew they weren't using their normal camera
"we alrady know its shot on iphone 15 pro, the quality is shit"
what’s your nationality ?
"I must say the action button can do it all, I have voice queues for tasks, calendar, notes, weather, etc and if nothing matches then trigger chat gpt voice. Shortcuts and automation is nothing new but a dedicated action button motivated me to use it."
"I like how the iPhone 15 Pro looks but honestly, is it that much of a technological upgrade?   I have the iPhone 13 and aside from Dynamic Island on the newer iPhones, I have to ask if it’s really worth upgrading?   Personally, I think smartphones have peaked and there’s not a lot left to offer as far as innovation goes.  It’s the same model year after year with only slight improvements.  Oh, and if you think saying you’re 30 feels weird, wait till you say 40!   Time flies 😄.  Great review"
WHAT DID NOT EXPECT IT WAS SHOT ON IPHONE!
"4:30 just me who finds the ""slide to open"" the camera app the fastest?"
Love to see that FC Barcelona shirt again 🙌
"Man, I was thinking Marq got some serious camera quality there. then he said its all shot on iPhone 15. pretty mad."
I thought you were 26 not fucking 30! You look young!
What backpack was that? 5:54
My 15 pro max is amazing. I upgraded from the 12.
What’s u r opinion about upgrading 13 pro to 15 pro max ?
what a flex on the 911
MKBHD IS A BARCELONA FAN 😮
"Hey, nice production but I don't see a focused point here. In your reviews of phones you have few pillars that you use to look at the phone. This seems all over the place describing what seems to be tertiary points and a 3 month later phone review could have some additional pillars or maybe a relook of the pillars. So some focus might be great."
Great video marques
I will forever remember holding my first ever iPhone 4… iPhones have come very far very quickly. I can’t wait to see what is to come!!!!
what that's crazy the whole thing shot on iPhone that's great
There’s a new dog!
"I saw you on the Cover of Fast Company & read the amazing article about you! You also bought yourself a $250,000 2024 Porsche Turbo! What a Life, MKBHD, you have carved out! I'm soooo bleeping jealous & proud of you! You are absolutely killing it, in the life dept. You totally deserve your success cause I know how hard you work & how talented you are! An amazing combo situation!  PS: I did copy this over from your older 40,000 iPhone Video, but I wanted to make sure you read it, so I copied it over! 😉🤨😝😛👽👻"
Boosting iphone sales 😉
OnePlus 12 review?
MK Barcelona HD
living with 911! (hmm)
That’s a wallpaper I haven’t seen in a loooooooong time
"The front camera in the 15 pro is absolutely trash though, it doesn’t capture the bright light at all. Looks good when taking the pic but gets dull when captured, is it just me?"
I just updated from XR to 15 yesterday glad you said this was a upgrade worthy phone
Thank you
I programmed my action button to precondition my Tesla! Super useful
Got my 15PM right when they dropped & it still overheats horribly when charging even after all the updates 😒
"That camera action button you are using, it comes from muscle memory on Android. Double tapping the power button is the way to go."
I’m watching a review of phone with me knowing that I can’t buy it 😂
did someone just called Porsche 911 boring?
Surprise how people claim things essential to their lifestyle when it was barely added to their lives a few years ago.
6:27 which weather app is this ?
Barca fan?!🤨
Mkbhd in a Barcelona kit una
"Upgraded my ancient Galaxy S8 to 15 Pro a month ago. I admit all iPhones are way overpriced in my country, but after a lot of consideration, the regular 15 offer less value for money in my opinion. So, I just bought the 15 Pro, and it's the best decision for me. Now, I will use this phone at least until the iPhone 20 comes out 😂"
the plot twist at the end im screaming
"@mkbhd congrats on the Porsche and happy birthday. Should’ve thrown in Porsche latest drop, and the interesting story of the 911 and its refinement."
OMG! Apple finally figured out how to get people to turn a phone to the horizontal position to take videos! 🤯🤯🤯
How to get the wallpaper
Youur iphone crooked
Shit it was shot on iPhone
great video and the iphone 15 pro takes great video i can't decide if to get the 15 pro or 15 pro max I am still using 14 pro max
"On march I got the iPhone 14 pro max, so ima wait for the iPhone 18 to do an upgrade"
Put your real Madrid shirt in next video
shot on iphone and yes it looks bad
Barcelona Stan?😢
There's actually no way it's all shot on the 15. That looks incredible!!
Belated 30th Happy birthday Marques. Have a good one
"The moment I launched the video, I immediately noticed the quality drop and knew you were using an iPhone.

There is no way MKBHD would lower the standard of his video quality."
The Biggest UNINTENTIONAL Apple Sheep on the planet.
Wish he did on pro max.
ForcaBarca Vamos !!!! 😍
"Using iPhone 15 Pro Natural Titanium since launch and not case only tempered glass and still like new, the frame reminds me iPhone 6 back in the day."
"10:10 ofcourse once I maximized  it, I felt it too"
I came from the 13 only bcuz someone broke my camera smh but as always I like it and i can't complain
I thought your skin looked weirdly different
What is that weather apl?
Nice! Could you do one for pixel 8 pro?
Hey marques make a video shot just on the pixel 8 pro
"Shot on an iPhone 15 pro and I couldn't even tell the difference, absolutely crazy"
"The 15, in regular and pro, are not the interesting choice but it certainly is a standard. The 11 before was a standard level iphone, the 13 was one too, now the 15.

But the difference with the 15 is that with usb c, its relatively complete. Sure there can always be things ppl want or wish for. But for avg consumers, theres nothing left for it to do/offer other than no notch or island. So the 15 will become the new m1 macbook air, in that it will stay on the line up for a bit and just be the entry yet best performing device for most users. Till they release the new se4."
Pleas wiil you buy me iphone if you can❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
"How to have eternal Life

1. Believe that you have sinned (done wrong) and that Jesus can save you.
""All have sinned and have fall short of the glory of God"" 
Romans 3:23.

2. Ask God to forgive you and make your heart clean in Jesus name.
""If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness"" 1 John 1:9

3. Tell Jesus that you want him to be Lord of your life (that you will serve him).
""If you declare that Jesus is lord, and believe that God brought him back to life, you will be saved"" Romans 10:9.

4. Trust Jesus to set you free from wanting to sin and to give you a new life that will never end.
""Now you have been freed from sin and have become God’s slaves. This results in a holy life and, finally, in everlasting life""
Romans 6:22"
so nobody gonna talk about the jersey hes wearing
still rocking the classic og wallpaper
I'm disappointed to see you in a Barca jersey. I've noticed many African thieves wearing that jersey (you can check online). I always thought you were a Real Madrid fan like me. Halamadrid
I am facing am issue after latest update my 15 pro going switch off when i zoom in and zoom out the videos in the photos
Can you map the action button to serve as a trigger button on FPS games like PUBG or COD for example?
how could i forget they said in the podcast that they will do the same thing as that Apple event 😂
Shot on iPhone*? Or shot on iPhone?
"Thank you, I will now upgrade from my 11"
How did you shoot the video of the phone with the phone in the frame!? 🤯 I have the 14 Pro and I’m keeping it until apple does something about Siri or the battery life.
My favourite shortcut for the action button is a shortcut that opens up a menu with multiple shortcuts
love the shirt
Seriously bro?! Barcelona?
Really? No word on the shitty battery?
I downgraded from the 13 pro max to the 15 pro and I love it!
"10:10 ""Also, this entire video, every single shot was shot on an iPhone 15 Pro"" 🤯 👏💯"
Using s23 without case & screen protector for the last three months since purchase. 😌
9:25 You compared Samsung S23 Ultra to Porsche 911. Not this shit phone 😅
Did you know that in Japan Samsung smartphones aren't labelled as Samsung smartphones but you only see the provider's name and the model name on the device due to a lot of Japanese still being racist against Koreans (even though Japan is the criminal in this case).
Not the Barcelona kit 😂😂
My eyes was on the Barca 2021 kit 😂
just got my 15 Pro max other day and here's the review nice
"Other companies have been rapidly switching to different exterior designs of their phones and people use that to declare the iPhone ""exactly the same"" ignoring all the under the hood changes and improvements but this comparison with Porsche 911 is evident that it's a fashion clothing line and they aren't obligated to change designs. The iPhone design looks so elegant and simple that they may keep using it for another 10 years and it would still stand out."
I might consider unfollow since you wearing a barcelona shirt
What backpack was that when you pulled out the AirPods Max? 5:55
Barça un the house
"lets gooooo!!! one cable for my

Battery drainage is the only issue facing in iphone 15 pro😢 rest all are ❤
What's with the Porsche app?
"The phone is getting sooo hot when i play some regular games
Why no body talks about it 
My affordable Android phone is doing better than 15pro"
"This video should not exist, and if it must exist it should be one minute long."
Visca Barça!
Happy buiday!!! 🎉
Its not completely made from Titanium
Nice video
"i use the action button to detect if i am wearing earbuds and shuffle a spotify playlist (based on my focus mode) or toggle background sounds if audio is already playing

if im not wearing earbuds/headphones, it performs different tasks (again based on focus), but defaults to opening the camera"
"Favorite part of your videos is that you are un-bias even when you get these opportunities(Apple Park visit, etc). We all appreciate ya. You represent us all on some level. Have a spectacular New Year and hope you had a great Christmas"
"wow, i just upgraded a few days ago from 11 pro. for me, usb-c was what i was waiting for since now i have a dozen electronics i regularly use, and they all charge via usb c

i was also dying to have a 120hz screen and the 5x telephoto will be useful to use during lectures in class"
"""I just happen to have one of the most expensive set of headphones ever made. Idk if thats affects everyone."""
"I went from a 7 Plus to a 15 Pro Max. Needless to say, HUGE difference, but as I compared it to my mom's 14 Pro Max, I honestly didn't feel that much of a change. I don't know, maybe I just didn't test the correct stuff."
Saaaammmmmeeee Aaaapppppllleee phone
Happy birthday 🎉🎉🎉mkphd
"I use the action button ALOT. Discrete way to get a voice note. 

Love it!!"
Porsche looks fine. I hope there's an autofocus episode in the line. Please bring back Q/A videos.
THANK YOU MKBHD! 🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿
Do a pixel 8 pro long term video review
It wasn't the EU! That's what the media wants you to believe. The new Log video feature couldn't work with lightning. Apple should have done it sooner. But it's not because of the EU!
"OMG I am crying and I feel compassion for you, I don't understand what you're wearing, I really do feel sorry and I hope you recover soon... I love your channel, but I don't know why you are going through this phase of wearing that shirt. I hope it doesn't give you hives."
Happy Birthday 🎉
turbo s is crazy
"When you said always carrying 2 phones I realized even tho you have lots of phones to experience, you have to bear that iPhone since you are in USA and Apple ecosystem locked. Damn thats a struggle."
He didn’t mention anything about the bugs and overheats and battery drainage. Either he conveniently got one not bugged or this guy doesn’t use his phone as much as he says he does
Wow! First time I see Marques wearing a T-Shirt with Nike Logo! Loved the review!
For me I keep accidentally hitting the action button instead of the volume button
LOVE YOUR VIDEO!
"This is why on my headphones i could hear a weir hum in the background, i thought i was imagining things"
Tbh I don’t even use the action button I forget that it’s there.
"I just want to post something out of subject.

 I went to home depo today and I forgot to take the measurement of a hose connector for the faucet. I remember the iPhone has a ruler function and decided to give it a go….and it worked like a charm. 
I know the iPhone isn’t a top of the line Android phone, but I really love the simplicity of it and of all these extra features that are part of the os, like the measuring stuff, the built in screen record, built in barcode scanner , the built in sound search apps and more, may seem like a gimmick, but there’s have been a few times I really was glad that the phone came with those thing built in already, just things that helps the phone make a bigger impact."
love you mang shout out 609
"I think when you're rich and have f it money it's when you don't put a case or screen protector on your phone lol. 
What does it matter when he'll be switching phones in like 3 months of that. 
I got that glass screen protector, otter box defender case AND camera lense protector on my S23 ultra I ain't playing lol"
didn’t know Marques is a Barca fan ❤🎉
Please wear a Real Madrid jersey
Crop button crops the photo. Okay.
Barcelona Jersey 🔥❤
"it's crazy how despite things like IP68 certification and water proofing become standard in flagship phones now, they are more fragile than ever. It used to be normal to not have a case on your phone but now it's suicide to go without one. They're just all glass now, any little drop will crack or shatter them. And they're too expensive now to risk that happening. Drives me nuts."
Noo not barca jersey🤦🏽‍♂️
Would’ve hoped for a little more insight with regards to battery life. Other than that I thoroughly enjoyed watching this in depth review.
shot on iPhone
Changing the phone's port to usb-c while keeping the ports of their other devices as lightning ports would be the most Apple thing to do.
"Really enjoying the 15 Pro Max, what they did this year with the cameras is soooooo mint!💯😃"
Omg I just played the video once more to saw that really shot on iPhone 😅
Gets hot while charging
That Barcelona jersey is fire
"You can actually open the camera just by sliding to the right on the Home Screen. Fastest way for sure, as it takes like 0.2 seconds rather than the 1.4 seconds when holding pressing the action button."
"The reveal in the end that it was shot on the 15 Pro this entire time, masterfully timed. Crazy quality"
Oneplus open giveaway has been forgotten?
Thumbs down only for barcelona kit
"Didnt think MKBHD is a football fan, FC Barcelona shirt looks good on you"
Visca el Barça 💙❤️
"Marques I love your videos! But as a Real Madrid fan I just can't watch when you wear a Barca Shirt. I'm sorry, but I'm going to have to dislike and not watch this one :("
Thank you Europe 👍👍👍👍👍
Forza barca!
could tell it was shot on iPhone because the exposure is set too high
😍😍😍😍
"When is Android getting those features?
Such as being able to map the side button"
Congratulations on the 911 turbo 😁
Love the FCB t-shirt
No wonder the color was a bit off compared to the usual video
I am jealous that you got the 911 before me… even though I don’t have that kind of money 🤣🤣. Anyway congratulations brother!
Força Baça ❤️💙
"My action button tweets. Twitter is my diary, by the time I open twitter, I often forget what I wanted to say. So I just hammer on the action button and tweet away."
"Sounds like an upgrade for me now.  Good video, thank you."
congrats on the new porsche marques!
is there a backstage video of what additional equipment was used for shooting this video?
Video is sick.  Can you please share the awesome wallpaper?
Loving my iPhone 15 pro max
"1:11 Didn't Jerry Rigs literally open it, show it and then melt it to show that the inside frame  is actually stainless steel fused with titanium?!"
FLEXX GAME STRONG
uhm.. is it just me or is there static when Marques is talking? It's like a light constant shhhhhh of static noise or white noise in the background. Great review though as always.
Visca Barca
"I could definitely tell you filmed this on an iPhone, dynamic range seemed off, and it adds odd sharpness to the water on your car making it blend in with the pavement."
Ngl... I was thinking that the video quality looked great.. and then he spilled the beans on it being a 15 pro!
"owns a proshe, why would he worry about dropping an iPhone lol"
What? FCB? you will get many madristas angry
The Jersey tho
"My iPhone 15 Pro battery life is the worst I’ve had in a phone in a long time, iPhone 13 Pro had better battery life than this… 😢"
"Thanks for the feedback after 3 months of use.

Regarding the action button - ""Just being set to open the camera. That's the fastest, most convenient way to get to the camera (for me)""

Swipe LEFT (Anywhere) on your lock screen is a faster way to get to your camera, just saying."
Was the dog in the background wearing AirPods Max lmaoooo
"Funny how the USB speed of the ""Pro"" lineup is a headline feature. 
When they could easily do it on the regular models."
iPhone sales after he said the video was shot on iPhone 📈📈📈
Happy birthday
I love that the phone looks like a iPhone SE in your hands 😂
I will say I did think that the RED footage did look slightly overly sharp on skin tones and that made sense after I watched the ending. But certainly didn't look bad and I would've never known if I hadn't watched all the way till the end. Well done.
What model is your Porsche
Hi Marques. As you have recommended this year's iPhone pro is to get specially who are coming from older models. Which year's iPhone users should upgrade you think? From iPhone 13 or iPhone 12 and older ones'? Thanks!
wow really recorded with phone???
How come you didn't mention battery life at all? Especially that the 15 pro has the worst battery of the entire lineup
"my iphone 15 pro max 1tb has hit the 99 battery health 🥲now I am getting depression and anxiety attacks, probably gonna buy a new one cuz I can't take this anymore"
Visca el Barça! 💙❤
amazing camra video
"Scrolling, I thought was Jerry rig (cover) 😄"
"Waiting for ""the making of.."""
Man said a Porsche is not flashy😂😂
I always love the irony that DBrand is such a prominent sponsor but Marques rarely puts cases on his own phones.
Booooooo! Hala Madrid!
Great video as always… just really thrown off with the Barça jersey… 😂
DEMBÉLÉ
HALA MADRID
Happy birthday mate!
"I also don’t like that 3rd party apps have a hard time focusing on close subjects, like scanning a QR code"
Got mine last weeeeeek lets goooo
🤯
"I don’t like that apple has the “currently playing” Lock Screen notification (with volume and seek bar) at the bottom of the screen. 

The amount of times I go to unlock my phone (swipe up after Face ID) and accidentally seek to a random place is more than I can count"
"Marques, I must confess I was not expecting to see you wearing a FC Barcelona t-shirt hahaha
Congrats from Spain 🇪🇸"
6:15 => Is that a puppy in the background? 🤩🐕
"Hey Marques, I've got a question. I know that you love 30fps so this might not sit that well with you, but just hear me out.

I currently own a Samsung flip 4, and I also have an older Oneplus 9 pro laying around; both are 120hz but the oneplus has a feature where it upscales all content to 120hz from whatever it was before. This is true on most apps I use, like YouTube and Netflix.

Watching Netflix side by side with both phones, it almost looks like my Samsung is lagging, even though it doesn't seem like it otherwise. The upscaling tech is just that good. 

Why don't more companies include this in their phones, especially when SoC's are faster and faster? It looks incredible, I've honestly not noticed any issues with it."
Barca fan Marques :)
Set the action button to a shortcut folder and it shows a nice menu
broooo not a Barcelona kit whyyy :(
Yes but do we (as a society) really have to mention it’s partially made of titanium every time we talk about it? How on hell is that supposed to be the selling point?
Happy bday marques 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉❤
Barcelona 😍
MKBHD next time wear a real Madrid shirt you are royal in every way so it’ll suits you just fine
Show us the car!!
The Jersey 🔥
"They should give you the ability to map an action for a single press, long press, and double press of the action button. is that asking too much?"
"MKBHD going to fancy dress party as Raphina, even grown the beard, Great review"
@6:27 what is the name of this weather app?
Loved the tidbit at the end that everything was shot on the phone!
I accidentally slide my blue 15 pro across a tile floor and it took a ton of the color off the side rails. Color is tough this year
10:18 I knew it from the very beginning. ❤
It's funny how iphone basically added samsungs Bixby button
"just bought mine, 15PM 2 days ago!, an upgrade from 11PM"
maybe one of your best reviews if not one the best of all time! thank you MKBHD!
Barça shirt 😁
I'm pretty annoyed with the durability of the screen glass. I had a 13 pro for 2 years and had less scratches on the screen that my 15 does in only 3 months.
Great Video
"I'd love to see a Studio channel video of this being edited. 

I'm curious how the process would be different compared to a normal video (not shot on iPhone)."
love your videos man .. keep going
happy new year in advance brother
a 911 turbo isn't flashy? OK sure
Can u link the Wallpepr ?
Please stop wearing a cheating team shirt. Please. Just don’t.
I’d rather have the action button out of the way rather than in the way and accidentally clicking it all the time.
This is a very in depth review but as a white woman I just can’t relate to this man. I wish there was more diversity in the tech review field. A woman or trans woman is needed in this field.
"This is one of the few times where being left handed helps me lol, the placement of the action button is actually great for me because 99% of the time my phone is in my left hand"
"I make short documentaries for news sites. I'm a one-man band so it's all run and gun. The iPhone 15 Pro camera is a game changer. I filmed my last documentary (in 12/2023) almost entirely on the phone. For that alone, this is the best phone I've ever used."
Can you do a S24 Ultra review with every single shot from S24 Ultra itself?
"Congrats on that 911 and HB, Marques!"
"Love the video but you called Galaxy a ""boring design"" because they kept the same look for 2 years and you called ""porsche"" to iPhone, I feel the biasness? 

and congratulations on the new car, you deserve it."
I appreciate the review; this just proves the iPhone 13 Pro Max is worth holding onto until the next upgrade. iPhone 16 Ultra? 👀
What was that weather app you were using in the video?
FCB? why?
"Protip I’ve been gatekeeping: set your power button to “type to siri” every time you hold it instead of activating siri it brings your keyboard to type, you can ask questions or set reminders! I primarily use it to remind me about things!"
although this video was shot on iphone 15 pro it doesn't mention what i think is the best feature of this phone - the ability to shoot in log format. which is insane for a smartphone as only professional cameras do this. this was my main reason to buy it. if you're into making videos and editing I 100%  recommend buying iphone 15 pro
You can double tap the camera lens to open up the camera. No need for the action button to be set to same
I hate USb c! Lighting was such a superior connection. I’ve broke two phones with usb c. You know why? Because the little connection blade inside is a weak spot. Admitt it marques. The lighting has all the connections around a sturdy metal shaft. Not a flimsy metal blade.  The save the planet stuff is just ridiculous. I have like 5 or 6 lighting cables. I should just throw them out? My next iPhone is going to be the last that uses lighting.the fucking European Union saved the planet with this one. Total bullshit. Companies fighting and the end user has to suffer.
Happy 30th birthday Marques!!🎉🎉🎉
Happy birthday bro
When will u show us the Porsche? Btw congrats 😊
Hala Madrid.
W jersey ❤💙❤️ visca Barca
Happy birthday dude
Wow. the iPhone 15 pro replaces a lot of digital camera
"I proudly glanced at my iPhone 15Pro. 
Yeah. After the last iOS 17.2.1 update, no heat issues, camera works even better now and gliding is smooth as silk. 
Noticed that the Battery quality in this particular model is top notch; it’s still at 100% capacity after 4 months and 4 software updates. 
It became hands down the best iPhone that I’ve ever owned yet. 

Pro tips: Only use 20W charger, preferably iPad 20W charger, so that there will be no heat on both iPhone n the adapter. The phone is cold as ice while charging. 
Only update OS when u have 100% battery n plugged in (trickle charging). Never update on battery; it’s hard on the battery and processor."
"We neeeeeddddd a behind the scenes for this pls🙏 (showing how you shot this entirely on the iPhone, like apple 😏)
Maybe on the studio Channel ?"
"Crazy that in all these time, no one has made an integration for ChatGPT with a voice assistant"
Love that you're wearing a Barca jersey! 😍
Why are you in a Farca jersey??? 😂😂
I avoid cuts by never setting my phone on its face besides on mousepads. I also avoid setting it on the camera bump glass too. Often setting on the edge of a table on the back.
I was wondering what’s that noise in the background until you said that it was shot with 15 Pro but still awesome video ❤️
"For me, all the buttons on the left are just in the wrong location. Maybe it is good for the lefties?!"
"Okay... darn it! You mentioned that when Apple did it, maybe you would try the same, but you caught me off guard. The ""entirely shot on iPhone"" at the end was surprising! It totally looks like any other amazing production of yours!"
"Cinematic mode is still not ready for primetime. Regardless, congrats on the 911!"
Fcb ❤❤❤
Does the isle disappear or can be moved away when looking videos/movies?
hala madrid 🤍🤍🤍
You can also just swipe right from the Home Screen for the camera! Saves that millisecond if you need it
Marque i was watching your vids back in the days when you were showing us how to root and put custom firmware on our Galaxy s1 ....remember Darky rom?|?|.  And now the bulk of your vids are about a closed off eco system of Apple...over priced electric cars and literally no down to earth affordable gadgets. Most people can not afford Tesla and Apple. I can't help but feel disappointed ...sorry...but its not just you its most of the tech reviewers on youtube get zillions of subscibers and forget what made them popular in the first place.  Just look at MrWhoseboss...all he cares about right now is overtaking Apple with youtube subscriptions.
Please make a porsche 911 video in your tech style
So are you selling your Red gear now?
Please shoot all smartphone reviews with that phone you review. Thanks
Go Barca!
All I wanted to know was how it handled when you drop it lol
"Hey, I’m having an issue with my Bluetooth / CarPlay phone call speaker volume inside my 2019 Honda Accord. It sound as if the person I’m talking to is in a hallway. I hope im explaining this issue correctly. My son and wife both have a 15pro as well and I’m having the same exact issue. 

Note: when I first got the 15 pro and before all iOS 17 updates, this issue was nonexistent. Please help!"
Barca ❤
Why you use small phone but you have a big hand?
I don't see the difference in quality when the video is done on a Red Camera or with an iPhone
please wear Arsenal shirt in the next video...❤
"Sold. I've been waiting on a finger print scanner under the glass, but this will do."
Hala Madrid! Puñetas. 🎉
Nice shirt 💙❤️
Força Barça❤️💙
"Portland, JAMAICA in the Building!!!"
"I will say that i’d expect to map my action button to open the camera as well. I’m not sure about others, but i’ve swiped away many notifications by mistake trying to scramble open the camera app via lock screen."
"Action button question but on Ultra 2, do you use it there? I want to, but had to turn it off because I kept ""bumping"" it whenever I bent my wrist."
I set my action button to Log water
Video looks great.
"U could tell, I keep telling my self there is something wrong with this video! ""It looks off"" ""it doesn't look like mkbhd regular videos"". These where just ringing in my head until he said, and I was like.....  of course"
Where can I get that wallpaper?? 0:03
"Stop flexing so much, also this is not a tech channel all you do is commercial reviews, like ad presentations but with a ""review""  essence. Nothing special at all"
No offence to your expensive cameras that you normally use but wow!!! All shot on iPhone and I watched this video on a 65inch TV and did not even notice any difference to your normal videos that are shot on Red or whatever cameras you use these days
"Happy belated birthday, Marques! One question; where are the Cheerios?!"
"As someone who works nights and is generally nocturnal, having the flash light on the action button has been game changing. I know the torch is on the Lock Screen but being just one button push straight out of the pocket is so handy."
congratulations! Show us the 911!!!! IN DEPTH REVIEW!
Keep that in mind the microphone is more important than the camera😂😂😂
"Oh dear, that’s so lame from you with this video"
Are we just gonna ignore the noise coming from the microphone?
Marques never fails to amaze me. Nice trivia at last!
"@ 5:14, why did you thank Europe, as in the continent?.... I think you meant to say that you thank the EU.
Great video, as always, Marques!"
Which weather app is that? 9:10
it still heats a lot if gps isnt on
That t-shirt hurt me like hell.  Mkbhd please put on al-nassr t-shirt for next video.😅
Barca stinks. But great video!
Not the Barca jersey
So @mkbhd action button is so amazing that you’re not sure which function is the best for it?
Respects for my guy for being team Barça ❤️💙
"Android been having an action button fully customizable... Apple stay behind, but Apple user act like they did it first ha ha.. Nope!"
"i knew first sec that it was shot on a phone, and ofcourse its the iphone , cont. the trend tho"
Barca fan? Why?
"Why is there a white noise in the background? 
Oh I get it, iphone cameras. The video quality difference was very noticeable."
love the shirt!!!
Wait is mkbhd wearing a barcelona jersey?!.......man you just keep evolving
"I have a 13 Mini, which I preordered after my carrier decided to not include my Redmi Note 8 Pro in their restrictive whitelist due to it ""not having voice over lte"" which it does have. Until they release another mini, I'm using the 13 Mini. If I didn't have an Apple Card that I like using, I would just buy a Zenfone 10. Next year if the iPad Mini gets an update, I may get a Zenfone 10 and an iPad Mini and just use the iPad to make payments and stuff for the Apple Card (I never use Apple Pay or whatever, I live in a rural area, and it isn't really widely available, I have to use the physical metal credit card if I use it physically).

I like small screen devices, I went through my period of phablets and large screens early on and have moved back to around ~5.6-~5.9 in being the sweet spot for me. The 13 Mini is still plenty quick enough for me, the battery has barely lost any capacity, and I get WAY more battery life out of it than most people that reviewed it (I use it for text, email, phone, simple browsing, and occasional videos; at home where I also work from I just use the Note 8 Pro to watch videos and other battery heavy tasks). I doubt they'll release another Mini again (despite being one of their best phones in a while IMO), so I'll keep the 13 Mini until I have to swap."
Marques started hiting 'punch line'
"Helllll of a flex at the end.... happy birthday, Marques!"
It’s been 3 months… wow.
"Switched from the 12 to the 15 Pro in Blue . I just love this phone . Better battery life (I was surprised) , better screen , 120hz rate is super fluid , the phone feels faster and smoother . For me the 4G speeds are faster too . Cameras are good . Video is so smooth . Tbh , I am glad I've switched to it ."
did you just call a porsche 911 boring unflashy and not dramatic....?💀💀
"i upgraded from 11 to 15 pro this year and i am in love with this one, same color no case its amazing"
What is the catch with FCB ⚽️. 🤔
what strategy ?!
Pretty impressive that the iPhone 15 can carry shooting a video for your channel.
Don't even think of cutting the beard. If you do God will slap you 😁😁 (IT LOOKS GOOD ON YOU)
"According to the new iPhone 16 leaks, the camera alignment is back in a straight line and I think it's for spatial video. Let's see! 🤔"
Advertising for Apple.
"VIVO X100 PRO World is on another level, please make a video about it.."
What weather app is that MKBHD is doing…?
"In the realm of life, a man I'll paint,
33, seeking fortune, yet tides restraint,
Mastered Arabic's allure, Islamic grace,
Excel sheets, Microsoft's embrace.

His heart sings Quran's celestial verse,
Hadith's wisdom, like treasures diverse.
Teaching, guiding, the essence of light,
Illuminate souls, in knowledge's flight.

A lone path he walks, seeking more,
Dreams of wealth, a girl to adore.
Not a gold-digger's tale, nor a scheme,
But an earnest quest, a shared dream.

In life's theater, this man plays his part,
Longing for love, a soulful restart.
A woman of truth, a Muslim's delight,
Joining hands, forging futures bright.

Dear woman of grace, with an earnest hue,
If these words resonate, if they ring true,
Seek not a prince with wealth untold,
But a heart, a soul, longing to unfold.

For him, a partner, a faithful guide,
A chance to grow, stand side by side.
A poem crafted with words refined,
A hope for hearts, in dreams enshrined.

May your path cross, in serendipity's span,
Finding him, a rare, kindred plan.
For a love that blooms, from seeds sown strong,
A union of hearts, where they both belong.

🌟📚💼🌙✨🌹📝🕊🧕💖🤝🌍🎓"
"you could’ve fooled me like Apple did when they said it was shot on an iPhone 15 Pro…looks spectacular and congrats on the dirty 30 club. as you enter, i am slowly, but surely departing as 39 approaches oh so fast….it’s okay….all i need is a few Porsche’s, Tesla’s and etc to help with a soon mid life crisis when 40 happens in 2025…😢."
Flex: To own a Porsche 911 at 30
"I think you meant European Union (EU), not Europe ;)"
Absolutely loving the Barcelona kit tho 💖
This guy is really good at his job 👍🏼
"No one else has noticed iPhone 15 PM having blurry photos on the the 1x ?  There are also Reddit posts about it… the camera needs a fix asap, it’s worse than the 13 pro max."
"he considers a flex having the apple vision, rather than having a porsche 911 😂 true tech enthusiast"
I really liked this review.  Something seemed really personal and in-touch with it.  Thanks Marques!
Why Barcelona 😭😭😭
"More life to MKBHD! Peace and Success to you! 🇧🇷

Even with the heat problems, my battery life on iPhone 15 Pro still pretty good (lasting all day long). I do cycles of 80% and 100% each week in slow and faster speeds. But sometimes i can't let for behind  my Galaxy S23 Ultra because I love the permomance of the camera, specially the zoom and I think the photo quality [sometimes] are better too."
I think the action button will be used for ai
This is the first time I am seeing you on barca jersey ❤
it doesnt justify the price anyway .
"My best action button feature is using the Actions app to allow phone orientation detection, making the action button do different things in different positions. Right now, I have landscape as camera, face down as silent, face up flat as flashlight, and upright as Siri telling me the weather."
Video quality of 15 pro is just in another level..❤
@mkbhd is a culer 💙❤️
"Great video as always Marques!! Maybe we will see new keyboards, mice and Airpods Pro Max with USB-C next year, because the European Union Law says it has to have an usb-c port products like, mobile phones, tablets and e-readers, digital cameras and video game consoles, headphones, earbuds and portable loudspeakers, wireless mice and keyboards, portable navigation systems."
Still rocking the 13 mini and watching this has really made me consider. Was going to try holding out for the 17 but now I might not.
That shirt is huge....Seasons greetings and Happy New Year
"Yes, I agree.  Contrary to all the negative reviews on iphone 15 pro, I think it's the first worthwhile upgrade since iphone 11 pro.  But hey, most people are clueless.  They all panned the iphone 6s when it came out, but the 6s was the best upgrade for 5 years around its time, and at the time, I also called it as the best iphone in a long while."
"Watching you from Spain, next time Real Madrid jersey please!😉"
"Phone battery is very weak,"
How ironic is it that the Dbrand sponsor of this channel is selling cases of phones when MKBHD is in Team No-case!🤷🏻
FC Barcelona? Bad choice Marques bad choice.
What is the name of that weather app??
"Wow, love it 😊"
Marques is a legit iPhone fanboy now
I want a new phone but i replace my iPhone every 5 years. I got a 12 so i will get the 17.
Damn that car 🥵
"Hey Marques, now that you’ve used the iPhone 15 pro for 3 months I would be really glad if you could gift it to me as a New Year gift 🎁 😅. As an old subscriber of your channel I think it’s a fair ask. Just a wish. Happy holidays!"
Action button seems perfectly placed for me as a left handed person ha
"Massive props to apple for that level of video quality. Didn’t even notice the difference, and considering how perfect his camera quality is normally, that is very impressive"
FC Barcelona?? Really ??
i'm i the only one who noticed the porshe app ?
15 pro is the best iPhone ive ever owned
When everyone says “from an older iphone”.  I would love to explain more what iPhones they are saying.  Like is it worth it from a 12? 10?
I like the Barcelona jersey ❤️💙❤️💙
Well congratulations on purchasing 911 🎉
The refresh rate/scrolling on that phone is absolutely horrific.
I just knew it
Why with the Barcelona jersey 😢
Congrats for the new  Porsche!!
Barcelona
i use my action button to shazam songs 😊
"Whoever edited or shot this video is too bright not the right colour grade 1min in and it feels so different, A few clips are 60fps."
When i started this video ... I was like damnn the quality and color contrast are amazing but at the end we came to know that its an iPhone ..... super cool !
"That is the BEST PURCHASE you've ever made!!!
It is my Dream Color and my Dream Car, and to see my favorite youtuber have it excites me and motivates me to but one before electric takes over the world"
"He said"" Flex, i know"" So non chalant😂"
Why ticktick and not things 3? Seriously
best
7:35 your eyes are next to each other and not on top of each other. thanks for the info 😂
"I agree. No need to upgrade every year. I upgraded after 4 years using iPhone 11 Pro and enjoying the 15 Pro so far. 
I'm using a case and a screen protector for my peace of mind. Not brave as some of you out there using the phone naked.
I also appreciate and enjoy long term reviews such as this one, hope more and more YouTubers follow this approach!
Pulled a sneaky Apple move right at the end I see.  Did you record this video in ProRes Log?"
Marques Kaleb Brownlee 🤔
Which is the weather app/widget that he's been using??
Took me months too to realize I can swipe on the dynamic island
I switched to the iPhone 15 pro max from Samsung this year. The action button is easy to hit by accident for sure but I got used to it and haven’t hit it in a long time. I have it set to call my wife if pressed because I have health issues. I really love it. I didn’t know about the focal length options that was cool. And all I do for my camera is lock my phone then got the Lock Screen button I love the feel of them they feel like real buttons.
whats that weather widget?
That fcb kit though👌🫶
Will it be sweet spot for upgrading when 16 comes out next year? ...
I would’ve loved the action button on the right side
I have my action button mapped to flashlight and I use it all the time because it’s just easier for me than tapping the screen and hitting flash light that way
Such a great video
and i was wondering what's off about this video
Hala Madrid!!!
Man i was trying to buy ur branded shoe its fucking expensive plus shipping to India is $450 man sorry if it was 189 as per the price I would have bought it😢
Hann no wonder why the colors of the video were more vibrant and saturated than the usual. It was shot on the iphoooooone.
Love the jersey Marques. Visca el Barça! 🔴🔵
marques happy birthday bro
Was I the only one who heard that extra bit of noise from the mic and thought it was recorded on an iPhone? I thought only the voice was recorded on the iPhone but the video? Wasn't expecting that
"Congrats on the 911 plunge. 
I need a review of that 911 the MKBHD way."
"9:55 if even MKBHD ""the tech guy"" had a plaid but got a 992 Turbo S that has to mean something"
Pulled a sneaky Apple move right at the end. very cool @mkbhd😁
Did you shoot the video using Apple Log? I’m curious to see what you think of that feature.
"i literally thought that it was a normal video captured by a professional camera, but you made me surprised"
HAPPY BIRTHDAY MAN YOU DESERVE THAT NICE MATTE PORCHE YOUR THE GOAT MUCH LOVE🎉🙌🫡
Congratulations for marking your 30th birthday. May you celebrate many more years. Your review are always the best for me.
Shoutout to MKBHD for being on of the last YouTubers who doesn’t start yelling and being over the top the second the video starts and still being able to keep our attention.
Yoooo that Porsche is sick haha
What is this weather app?
"Anyone notice the cute dog and a dude walking behind the scenes (6:14)(top right corner), dog looked chill and happy :)"
Awesome videos sorry I’m soo late
I’ve found that I’m still very much comfortable with my iphone 14 base model. I’m personally waiting for the iPhone 16 Pro which is rumored to have face id scanners under the glass so it can be a hole-punch style camera like androids as opposed to the pill “dynamic island” we have now.
"Anyone go from the pro max size to the pro? I’m considering upgrading from my 13 pro max, but I’m not sure if I want to do the 15 pro max this time"
Is no one seeing the Barcelona jersey😆💣
So you're using your MIA robot arm as a plant growing lamp to imitate sun's apparent motion? Nice flex.
Did anyone see the puppy that walked in the back? I did and it was the best part of the video 🦮
Flex man Flex <3
I think i have realized it recorded on not from his red cam because of the brightness and color.and I knew it use iphone 15 pro because Apple surprised us to with some thing similar thing ❤always love mkbhd style ❤
MKBeardHD
"congrats getting 30. I got 30 too in sep. I wonder how long it takes to ""get used"" to it? i mean i dont feel bad about it. its feeling like being 20 but with more reasonability. on the other hand we now are not called ""young adults"" anymore. i really dont know what i am actually trying to say... but congrats, welcome in the ""still young to be crazy but kinda reasonable enought to avoid darvinism""... club"
@mkbhd my update that I will like apple to introduce is Face I'd and Password before turning of your Phone.
I liked this video for the 911
Love the BCN jersey ❤
MKBHD you DO know that most people in this world own 1 device … a phone and change it when the old one breaks… I dare you to change from iPhone to android no extra device used.. all included icloud and keychain (used to be called Icloud keychain) i dare you.. try and port your passwords from iphone to android using only 1 device.. no cheating.
I set my action button to turn on and off VPN
I lost count of the flexes after the Porsche…
Correction you can't shoot spacial video from iPhone 15
"Nothing to say about this video,great as always 🤲🏻
But i love the Barcelona t-shirt,such a nice thing for a Barca fan like me😂❤️💙"
The swipe on the Dynamic Island tip is the most valuable tip I’ve learned haha. The constant carrot rain up there was killing me 😂
Plz can u do a auto focus of the Porsche
I’m not ngl ever since the 15s came out ky 14 pm battery has dropped it has become very laggy and finicky I kinda wanna upgrade but also not at the same time since it’s pretty much the exact same phone
Agreed with marques I have to carry lightning with me for my AirPods 3 it’s kind of a hassle
"Bro happy belated and congrats on the 911, complete 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥  I just got a 15 pro max yesterday. This video looks great!"
Thanks for reaffirming my belief. I phone 15 pro max is my trusted phone
The action button paired to the flashlight is 🤌🏼 I use it very frequently. The camera shortcut was not very useful since you’re already going to be looking at your phone for the photo. But the flashlight is being turned on to not look at the phone so it’s so fluid to reach in your pocket and have a flashlight turned on before you even point to illuminate what your trying to see
"Barcelona FC shirt?? come on bro, I don't wanna watch this video"
"Really liked that part where Marques buys a Porsche....""It is not flashy, its not dramatic, its boring, its predictable, its familiar, confidence inspiring""."
🎉HBD🎉
u bought a 911? so cooll
There's a weird white noise in the background in this entire video...
"3 months later, still a iPhone"
"Ok so the phone is sick, but slow mo video has not had an update since I think iPhone 7? Why is there no 4K slow mo 😂"
Need a Real Madrid jersey the next time!😄
we want a video about the ytb speaker
OK but does it fold yet??
Loved the video. Can anyone tell me what that weather app he is using is?
"I’ve just bought this phone. It is excellent however, the display appears grainy (like a film grain) especially on white and grey colours. Above about 75% screen brightness, it improves. However, really noticeable if you’re using the phone relatively close to the face. 

Has anyone else observed this? I previously had a 13 mini which did not have this issue. Have compared with a couple of my mates iPhones, and none seem to show this issue."
"Love your videos, love your content, love your energy, please don't use that shirt"
enjoy ur nu car barsa
"Another absolute hit, happy belated bday & continued success and blessing for you!"
"I was like: ""What's that weird fireplace in the background""? And then I saw the robotic arm! 😂😂"
"Are you a barcelona fan 😂😂
You are amazing man ❤❤
Ilove ya"
What's that weather app name? 😮
That wallpaper brings back memories
... you skipped over the 2nd flex... nice car.
what's with the FCB kit?
I wonder why nobody shoots a video from android phone(flagship ofcourse) and then reveal at the end? 🤔
What is that weather app??? 9:08
Please shot 1 complete video with s23 ultra… really want to see how that turns out with your professional touch.
Ayyyyy Marques wearing Barca colors in the video
"I wasn't expecting the shirt, visca Barça❤"
"10/10 video as always Marques, but come on man... Hala Madrid! :D"
this is best flex til date for me - porsche 911 just for 5 sec ...lol
I much prefer the glossy finish stainless steel on ip14.
Love my 15P! Easily two days on a charge.
"Would love to have a what on my iPhone, or tips and tricks video. Even on the studio channel."
saw that OVO shirt.
Was a fan of your's until you wore this barca's jersey .
But imagine waiting for the iPhone 16 to drop next year...dun dun dunnnn
How do we get that weather widget ? Could someone please help? It looks great!
Nah bro as soon as I got mine I put a case on it 😂
I was hoping you'd be a Real Madrid fan
"Wooh, Forca Barca"
I had to watch the video twice after he mentioned it was all shot on the iPhone 15 Pro
Do you think the 5x camera is worth getting the Pro Max for compared to the Pro?
DUDE congrats on the new car! She looks stunning. So happy for you and all you've worked hard to achieve.
"You are so articulate! Love all your videos, always!"
Action button was unnecessary
I upgraded from iPhone X to iPhone Pro Max it’s a perfect phone 🙂👍
"I just wanna know what weather that is at 6:27, I still have yet to find a good replacment to Dark Sky :( RIP"
"Has Ceramic Shield improved nothing? A few months ago I got a 13 mini and the screen has scratched the most out of all the phones I’ve ever had. BUTTT the back (Gorilla Glass) is exactly as it was the first day. So I’m begging they go back to Gorilla Glass for the next phones or to switch the focus of ceramic shield to be more scratch resistant. Im pretty sure most people prefer more scratch protection than fall protection, after all, if the phone falls and the screen doesn’t break the scratches from that fall would make it unusable. It doesn’t save you from a screen replacement in most cases anyways. My biggest disappointment to be honest, cause I like to go with the phone naked."
Yeah the camera is insane on this phone because WHAT 😂😂😂 imma have to shoot my vids on here too
"LOOOOOOOOL in this shots 2:30 i was thinking ""whats happening to the Black Magic cameras? this look way to sharp"" and i got my answer at the end of the video 😅"
"I know Apple will never do this because of their ""design language"" but it sure would be nice to have multiple action buttons like the macro buttons on a computer mouse."
I find the flash light on the action button very useful 😅
Can anyone help me out on the battery life info
"Would the iphone 15 pro then be a better choice than the normal 15? After the release most reviews recommended the normal 15 over the pro, but would you say that is still the case. I will be upgrading from an iphone 11 and have been wanting to upgrade for a while"
"whats the point of this video, kaksukah ? do the same video with android then ..."
Get a Shellrus Sapphire screen protector!  I hated screen protectors too until I got one of these!
I use the action button as a mute switch. It’s kind of just a downgrade from the old mute switch for me honestly.
I’ve had mine a week and I’ve dropped it twice…
"SHOT ON IPHONE? --- Noticed in the first few seconds :""D due to the artificial blur and lack of deep dynamic range that we are used to from your videos"
Don\t you have double-power button to start camera in jail?
"Do we have to spend so much to get a good phone😡😡😡….
let’s take a look at samsung: s21 is a all round good phone but not perfect, most of the photo issues can be fix with software updates and not to talk of the bad decision using plastic back. Then s22 came out, fix all the flaws and they decided to reduce the battery so that we wouldn’t be satisfied and wait for next version. s23 came out fixing all flaws again and then making all things better…
Hope y’all are seeing the games this people are playing us."
Hala Madrid
If I had his money and access to an unlimited amount of phones I wouldnt put a case on my $1000 phone either . But I have to get at least 3 years out of it so I’m on team case
Happiest Of Birthday Marques // Been watching you grow big brother since 2013 🫡🏁
Well i miss my iphone 5 of 7 years 😭 new Chinese battery exploded
What is that weather app on your phone....????
"""Three different focal lengths all with the same quality""

No. That's literally just cropping."
Barcelona Fan ✌️
"I have a Note 9.. without a case, and it still looks Brand New..
People these days have no respect for the things they buy..
They just buy a new one.."
Man this was the iPhone what the hell was it the microphone from the iPhone too?
Great review as always 🎉
10:10 is the best moment
That means my first iPhone purchase was a good decision 😂
What’s the weather app you use?
"Hbdmkbhd also, nc soft flex on that bday gift. 😂🤘"
Dont know if you looking at photos on phone even nokia n95 have perfect camera :)
Iphone video taking over the main channel ？ noooooo plz
shit shirt bro
"Dang, i did'nt see that coming😮😮😮the whole vid was Shot on an iphone 15 pro.amazing.😮"
Why he isn’t mentioning sharp rough edges gate at all anywhere is beyond me
"After ending i have a question: ""Are you sure you need a Red camera for videos?"""
Nice Jerseys bro
Marques with the crazzzzy flex at the end! Mic Drop!
Real Madrid 🤍
Happy bday Marques and nice purchase! Hope you really enjoy it 🤘🤘.
What weather app r u using?
I just got my 15 pro max a few days ago and its amazing. I had a 13 Mini and its most definitely a massive upgrade. I dont understand all the hate this phone got on release because its a great phone.
"So that what was off, the video was shot with iPhone 15. The quality is certainly amazing but I felt that something was off compared to other Marques videos. Great content as always."
Força Barça ❤💙
Nobody talking about that smooth outro ?
Wasn’t expecting to hear “Shot on iPhone” on this one……😅
Vibranium 😅
I’ll get you a Real Madrid jersey @mkbhd
"What a reveal at the end! The 911 followed by the ""shot on iPhone"" 🔥 congrats , Marques!!"
Bro just made a video about the iPhone to flex his new car. A chad indeed!
Happy birthday Marques! Congrats on your new Porsche 911
"the last part that you say that it was shot on the iPhone , that was a surprise."
"Hello 
Hi have a good day I really appreciate i like your content nice work."
I will be waiting on the long-term review of the 8 pixel pro
6:26 does anyone know what app that is?
7:14 *only on 15 pro and pro max
"My experience with the 15 pro w/ an otter box case, protector and a geo wallet: works fine, I rarely use the action button since I just leave it on do not disturb. Camera quality is really good but compare to my mom’s 15 there’s very little difference so imo it’s slightly overrated but still fine. I don’t like the whole switch to USB-C as I feel it takes away that exclusivity of apple but it does charge fast in my car where I use it the most, at night I use wireless charging which works great. I’ve only had the 6 and 11 iPhones and rn my ranking goes 11, 15 Pro, 6. Give it a few more years to really see how reliable this phone is but for now I’ll give it a strong 7/10"
thankeu for type c!
He’s wearing the barća jersey 😍
Give it to me..
I’m watching on a iPhone 15 Pro Max
"This has to be the best phone of the year 2023, I’ll always respect Apple for their gadgets 🫡"
"I watched every single of your videos about iPhone unboxing and review about it every single year. 
I'm agree that this year is the right time to upgrade. About 3 weeks ago, I just upgraded to 15 PRO Max from iPhone 7 that I've used since it launched and I'm happy with it and I'm confident that this iPhone will be my main phone for the next 5 or 6 years. I had hold to upgrade for several years and waiting for USB-C port and finally Apple did it this year."
"🥹🫠 I encountered a glitch when adjusting the brightness or volume, the screen brightness flashed quickly, the column I was adjusting also jumped and then stabilized, in a few minutes of adjusting it, it doesn't happen anymore, but if I leave it for more than 5 minutes and then adjust it, the glitch comes back!  I encountered it on ios 17.2, and still have it on 17.2.1"
Barcelona 💪
"Hi Marques a lot of people and specially content creators seem to be having problems with the 15 pro camera .. in both photos and videos..
Some of the complains are like  - 
1. Viewfinder image and processed image are completely different.
2. When recording video the quality is significantly bad when compared to 13 or even 12.
3. Sometimes the phone heats up too much and fails to save a photo.
4. Front facing camera has a weird grey dark tint.
5. Quality of images are very sub par.
6. also saw some creators complaing about the sunkissed or whatever images to be washed now and not look as good.

Saw a lot of posts on IG about how the 15pros cameras are a step backwards. All on YT every reviewr has nothing but good things about it."
"Watching on my iPhone 15 pro 
(I bought it today)"
"I got the iPhone 15 Pro Max a few weeks after it was released, and I was really excited to get USB-C on my phone. However, it also coincided with me switching to wireless charging for both my bedside charger and my travel charger, meaning that I actually don’t use the USB-C port much now."
"Just stop using iphone & get better earpods simple solution to that lightning problem. I got 1 cord that can fast charge my phone, earbuds, work flashlight, headphones, tablet, tv remote, Ps5 controller 😂 only thing it can't charge is my smart watch cause the circle magnet charging."
"This video is a masterclass about how to create great modern videos without a lot of gear. ONLY SHOT ON AN iPhone, anyone can enter this space! Thanks for all the great years of content @mkbhd"
Bro use some sibilance control on your audio.
You can view the spatial video on a Meta Quest headset or on any phone using a Google Cardboard or Gear VR kind of case as well.
The end is the best part haha! fantastic
Yeah swipe your smudgy fingers all over the front facing camera
Bro there’s no Apple CarPlay. WTF?
Summary of the video: MKB is a Barca fan ❤💙
bruh. i genuinely thought that this was shot on a normal video camera until the end!
Love the Barca shirt!!
What is this weather app 9:10
"No one else can subtly drop a double flex like that and still come across as humble, Porsche and Shot in iPhone 😅"
"Crazy that I was about to search for you age and u said a few seconds later before me hitting enter haha, damn it has been a long time watching you videos bro"
Where can I get that wallpaper?
tag line of mkbhd is there r lots of features but i don't use it or nevr try it yet 😅
Now I really need a Studio video revealing the behind the scenes of using an iPhone to shoot this video.
windows wallpaper in a mac computer ironically intelligent !
Holly shit! I also have 15 pro and this video opens up to me how capable iphone 15 pro is 😮
all real madrid fans unsubscribe
Looks like now videographers can ditch their expensive camera and their android phone and get an iPhone to do everything.
"strange that you get cuts on the screen, my pixel 7 pro shares a pocket with various other objects and has no noticeable scratches"
I have been with iPhone since the 3GS and recently went from the 13 to the 15 Pro Max and it feels like the biggest jump (that close in generations) from iPhone to iPhone to me. I was actually almost ready to switch to Android (Samsung S23 Ultra looked tempting) but I am SO glad I stayed with iPhone because the 15 Pro Max is just flat out amazing.
The best ad I've ever seen for an iphone(whole video)
Visca barca Marques!
"Get a clear, lipped case, basically a built in screen protecter!"
"You just turned 30!? You’ve interviewed a president, billionaires, been in the forefront with all that is new and you’ve only just turned 30!? Bravo 👏!!"
Didn't expect the extra button would have that many options that's cool
Flex. Good for u.
I love the jersey
Happy birthday!!!!!🎂
Shoutout to the Barcelona jersey. ❤⚽️
BARCELONA JERCEY😂😂
Pls share the wall!
"Ok that background in the very first shot brought back some old memories.
I used to also have that image as my phone background ages ago."
Congrats with the new Turbo!
whats up with the backround noise on this video??
"Hang on, why are you a Barca fan?"
Never thought i’d see Marques in a Barca top 😂😂
"How do you feel about battery life? My 14 pro is the worst I’ve ever experienced with battery, it’ll be at 50% within a few hours of use on basic things like Spotify or Snapchat"
Forca Barca
"I think action-button position is great, finally someone thinks about left-handed people"
that barca shirt ruined the video for me💔
"Wow the video quality was amazing, I didn't expect it.."
BARÇA ❤️💙
"the best part in this video is the 911 .. happy to see u finally buying a ""real car"" 😁"
Congrats on the new car
Still on my 13. Not upgrading for a while
terrible football jersey
What's the weather app?
Do you think it's worth an upgrade from an iPhone 12 Pro?
"@mkbhd Could you make next Samsung ultra and pixel pro review on their respective phone in similar fashion for comparison? 
Congrats for new car!"
That weather widget looks nice.
Happy birthday
"The depth effect of a stereoscopic image is entirely related to the distance between the 2 view points. If you want it to look similar to what we see in real life, you need the camera as far apart as your eyes are from each other. If they are as close as the phone, it would look really good for some macro video maybe, but pretty bland for anything else. Similarly, if you want an intensified depth effect on a large scale, like a city skyline, then you can take a picture, then run 10-20 feet and take a picture of the same skyline, and you’ll get the depth of all the buildings from the perspective of a giant.

My point of this comment is, in the form factor of a phone, you will never get a good depth effect, unless they decide to put a camera on a top and bottom corner of the phone. There is no other way to accurately achieve that effect without the physical distance between viewpoints. But who knows, perhaps there will be an AI model they feed the footage through pretty soon that enhances it. It’d still be fake but it could look good."
Is the oneplus open worth it? Like is the camera actually any good? Or should i wait for s24 ultra
When is the 911 review going to be posted?
"Barça’s jersey, no like 👎"
My guy rocking barca kit. King
Hands up if you knew the video was shot on iPhone before Marques said so 😂😂
Haven’t used a case or screen protector since I upgraded to the iPhone 13Pro Max. No regrets! Love the way the naked phone feels in hand and Apple has come a long way with their glass.
that flex was hilarious :-)
Where do I find the lock screen wallpaper again I can't remember the artist
I was wondering why everything is over colored and off focused.
refusing to put on on a screen protector is actually crazy. I've never been more scared in my life
The purpose of this whole video is to flex the 911😂
El-Classico....❤
visca el barça ♥💙
"Dude bought a 911 just to compare his statement he made 3 months ago.
Such dedication. 🙏🏼"
"VISCA BARCA, Marques!"
"Give me back my iphone 13 pro max, anyone that says this phone is better is lying. I really regret getting the 15 pro max..."
"You don’t usually do “X months later videos”. This was just an excuse to record a full video on the iPhone 15 Pro while not telling anyone and then revealing it at the end, wasn’t it? 🥸 If so, then you definitely succeeded. 😎"
Barce ❤
"Are you Barca Fan, common marques you are Real Madrid of tech……"
"I understand why you don’t want to put a case one, but what’s the reason for not putting on a screen protector?"
"I use the Action Button as a custom Quick Launcher with the following included: Camera, Lightroom, Music, Podcasts, X & the Playstation app."
"Ok not gonna lie, the fact that it's hard to tell the difference between iPhone footage from professional camera footage is insane."
Hala madrid
Bro Dropped a bomb @10:10 casually!
"Watching from Barcelona, love the t-shirt!"
Love your T-shirt!
When will the price drop back to last time price for us in third world countries
what's his weather app?
Garuda Linux!
Its crazy how in a decade Marques has grown so much.. from a tutorial video.. to a Porsche 911 ?????? Thats insane bro.. congratulations
amazing video marques but why the barca jersey 😭
Why does it look less like review and more like a Sales pitch?
"gayphone, man all these giant companies like apple microsoft google are pushing this creepy lgbt+ propaganda like its getting toxic at this point i removed all google stuff from my phone you guys should the same"
Love the shirt
"""the entire video was recorded with the iphone""

...start watching the video again"
Congratulations on the Porsche 911 turbo s. That was a wise financial decision
Was the audio recorded on the iPhone too?
The rumours about the iPhone 16 that it will have a 6.3 inch display and the 120mm/5x periscope telephoto cam.
"Even though I'm not buying the product, I still enjoy watching the videos. All the best for 2024, Marques !"
Happpy 30th 🎉
"average american who only knows messi in ""soccer"" supporting the shittiest team ever"
"flex, I know"
Action button open Camera. Long press in Camera will starting to take a video
Congratulations on the 911!!
For someone who named the pixel 8 as the phone of the year. You use and enjoy the iPhone 15 pro a lot. Not sure why it is not the phone of the year.
Can we have the same for Google P8 pro? I know that has been your daily driver for sometime now
"As a left-handed person, the action button is in the perfect spot for me. If you haven’t noticed, the iPhone is oriented for a right-handed person, down to the OS itself, especially for texting and anything with a “send” button."
"Came for the review, got the flex that marques played with Apple vision and bought a Porsche"
"Awesome review, as usual!  FYI: I set the action button to open ChatGPT 4."
Weird flex in the end.
Question ¿was the video shot appple camera app or black magic?
I use my action button for Apple Music
5:06 spoted a windows on a mac 😅
dude you're so cool
Excellent report and great shirt!!
Imagine the Pro Max
"A week or so after I got my 15 Pro (upgraded from iPhone 11 and justified it as a business phone :p) I felt a bit weird about it bc it wasn't as flashy and new as I thought it would be, but with time passing I‘m noticing all the changes - my videos and photos look a ton better, I worry a lot less about my battery since I usually still have plenty in the evening, everything is snappy and fast & cropping images (since I‘m not that great at framing 😁) after the fact actually is usable quality wise, as well as many other quality of life changes. Hell, I‘m even able to do many productivity tasks on it where I‘d previously had to grab my tablet or computer! The higher max capicity also allows me to keep my entire local music library on my phone again too which is a plus and saves me the price of music streaming services. 

I would have liked to have an under screen fingerprint reader for two factor, but otherwise I‘m really happy with it!"
This video was filmed on the 15 pro- amazing!
I love MKBHD videos because he can make the iPhone's old Android features sound cool.
Last time i bought an iphone and it was 12 pro which I've given to my little brother and i think everyone should avoid apple anti things to make a good force to apple
I use the action button to launch the myVW app so I can remote start my car
Look at white stone dome screen protectors. They’re incredible. Might change your mind on screen protectors
Barca W
Wil you do this with the versions to come of the samsung galaxy a series(think a55 and/or beyond)
Are we announcing what phone we used to film these days? Did you also eat food and breathe oxygen? 😂
"I recently upgraded to the 15pro from my old 12 mini. I used to love the small size but after getting used to this phone im not looking back. I'm not a power user by any means but the few key things like the batter cameras, and most of all the battery are huge improvement. I charge this phone every other day with normal use and even with heavy used I think I would have trouble draining the battery in a day."
"Noo dude, get rid of this ugly T-shirt if you really love soccer, please"
"Showcasing new Crop feature with a Google Pixel* 8 Award Picture on a Iphone, 2:10 (just marques things 😄)"
Congratulations on the Turbo S
My 15 Pro lives in a case. I have the 512 version.  No problems here
What's the weather app shown at 6:26?
noise reduction for the video pliz
Happy birthday MB my 30th birthday too. If you ever find yourself on Kent Island buy a screen protector from me! 🤣 enjoy your vids man keep it up.
Marques please stop using that horrible t-shirt
Real Madrid fans are going to hate this video! XD
"Happy birthday brother, wishing you from Ghana"
"congrats marques on growing older (kekew) and the 911, looks great. i agree with everything u said about the 15 pro, just need the money to buy it lol"
"My bro just made the video to show his 911 

Yo can give the specs of the 911"
Had the iPhone 11 before I upgraded to iPhone 15 pro 256gb few weeks ago definitely noticed the difference so much faster and smooth and with the Apple Watch ultra 2
"im Sorry to Say.. Andriod Better,.all Around Better, for who have like another tech support android.. bigger family"
I feel like an old man but I can't overstate how useful having the action button as a flashlight has been
Such a flex at the end of the video. Love it 🎉
Bruh I thought people were over reacting when saying the back glass shatters easily…until I dropped a small metal number lock on it from like 2cm and now my back is cracked
Barcelona loves you Marques!
"YES, it finally happened, you got a 911!  Big congratulation!"
"wow, i have been using an iPhone 11 Pro Max for many years since launch without a case i have dropped it and did everything that could happen and so far have no scratch anywhere.. no clue how people manage to scratch the glass and stuff."
"holy shit dude, congratulations on the 911!"
30👌
nice FOOTBALL**  t-shirt
"Say what u will about camera quality,  since the beginning of this video I've been thinking the exposure if way off. This isn't his red camera"
Givaway i need that
I recently bought an iPhone 15 Pro Max and for the battery backup and the camera (as a smartphone) I can confidently say this is the year to upgrade your phone
Am I the only one thats kinda disappointed in the battery life?
iphone 15 pro max and iphone 14 pro max green screen problem is a big bummer . Hope that you make a video about it
Should you upgrade to this phone from iPhone 11? I’m stuck between iPhone 15 pro or S23 ultra (mostly for the zoom) please give any advice!
"That deep scratch along the front is sorta concerning. My 13 pro never had a screen protector and I do roofs with it everyday. A lot of that time it’s in my tool belt,sometimes with nails and etc and I don’t have any scratches like that."
I am still not buying it😅😅
"""This entire video was shot on an iPhone 15 Pro"".... The first thing I noticed at the start of the video was that something was off with depth of field. It's overdone like HDR was for a while 10 years ago. They need to improve their depth algorithms as it really lets it done. the in focus parts look great."
"been watching since you were in college. business school if i remember correctly. i absolutely love your content. crazy that you turned 30, but what a beautiful car 🙌🏽🙌🏽"
"This is what a user experience video should be.

Most of the guys out there do 1/3 months video and basically re upload a review"
Hi. I notice in your videos you use the black sports band with the Apple Watch Ultra? Is that your go to band? I mean I have the Apple stainless steel link bracelet but I don’t think it suits the ultra
"My 13 is perfectly fine tbh, I would love to upgrade just because but the camera is still fine it doesn’t stand out as old yet. Performance I don’t play games, and battery is not annoying me yet"
"Wtf 😂😂
I didn't expect the Barcelona kit"
Can we have a BTS of this video on the studio channel ?
W shirt
Forca Barca ❤🩵
Looking to get a Lamborghini for my birthday 🙂
5:56 that backpack is lit as hell!? anyone knows where I can get it!?
7:15 Correction: 15 Pro or 15 Pro Max. Spatial Video isn’t available on 15.
"Don’t often disagree with you Marques but I think you thanking the EU for forcing a company to change any part of their design, especially something as unimportant as the charge port when far more important things exist like lack of security and OS updates to protect customer data on most Android manufactures exists. I doubt  99% of iPhone owners care about the charge port type. Most of my family are annoyed that they need to fork out money to change chargers, car chargers and docks etc are no longer compatible, and annoyingly they blame Apple for changing the port. They don’t care about USBC, they just want the phone charged. NO GOVERNMENT should control what a privately owned company does, if anyone honestly doesn’t like Lightning and it’s that critical to your workflow to have USBC then you have a choice, Android.  Once governments start to interfere like this and they get our support, they then push other changes like forcing manufacturers to provide governments decryption keys to our phones, back door access just in case we are naughty and they can call it anti terrorism laws. Only a matter of time, they start off small then as we accept each change they raise the stakes."
"Bro …..
You bought a 911 !!!!!
Congrats I love that car 👌👌👌👌
I was shocked an amazed at that but then you told the whole video was shot on the 15 pro !!!😲😲😲😲"
"The quality of video of the iPhone is mind blowing, is way far ahead from any other phone by miles. 
Congrats for the new 911 🎉"
"Upgraded from the standard iPhone 11 and its awesome. Mainly just way better battery life and screen/camera quality, but yes the placement of the action button is a bit annoying cause I try to change my volume while in my pocket and mistake it for a volume button a lot."
"Noticed the camera difference right when I clicked, IDK but red camera just has a unique color and texture to it"
Well...that fc barcelona shirt fiiiiiiiire❤
shot on iphone
The 911 turbo is 👌🏾
You have more patience than us lol. I had an iPhone 14 pro for 8 months and I traded it in because it was so goddamn bad. My girlfriend had her 15 pro for 2 months and exchanged it because it was terrible. Both got S23 and S23 Plus on the Samsung side and they're better in virtually every aspect for our use case scenario.
"I actually really like the multiple focal lengths feature. I had an iPhone XS before I upgraded to the 15 Pro, and I always took pictures with the telephoto camera because it made the photos look more professional and more like a DSLR.
And now with the 15 Pro I can always get the highest focal length possible for whatever picture I wanna take. If I can't get far enough from the subject to use the telephoto lens I can use the 35mm focal length.
This feature is really great if you want your pictures to look a *_tiny_* bit more professional."
"If you remember that wallpaper, you're qualified for a veteran's discount."
Apple paid good Money.
Team Barcelona⚽⚽
When he said every single shot was shot on the iPhone I just had to rewatch to really appreciate how impressive the iPhone's video taking ability is. The USB type c and the ability to shoot log are among the best upgrades for me.
I just knew we’d be getting a “everything shot on an iPhone 15 pro” at the end!
Bro a Messi fan confirm 👌🏻✅
Barcelona
Hmm. I noticed the robot camera said MIA (missing in action) on it and was wondering why. Now I know.
Is the Tesla gone?
"Can they fix this issue of volume not always showing or working properly on WhatsApp each time users try to increase the volume to view people's status on iPhone? A friend told me the same thing today he's been seeing the same thing and always restarts his phone. It is very annoying that this is happening on an iPhone, @WhatsApp please fix this issue for users and it is becoming damn annoying."
"The subtleness of you, your expressions & your videos Marques. Like “I’ll spend 10 damn minutes talking about how iPhone 15 pro is THE DEAL, but I’ll drop the actual truth bomb ever so subtly in the very end. 10:08“ Just amazing!"
"is it just be or the selfie camera in the pro its so bad and grainy, how do I fix it"
What a lengend
"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa it’s made with titanium not from titanium key words there buddy…"
As an apple fan boy of years. I think it’s time I leave the circle. The google pixel 8 pro has got my attention.
"what about the battery, I heard the processor is consuming"
Can anyone give me one iPhone
"ChatGPT doesn't do calculations, it vomits well-written text. That's all it does, nothing more."
Apple paid him again
Pro max better
the processed intro of your face was a dead giveaway it wasnt your normal camera setup.
I love you marques but i gotta leave a dislike because of the barcelona kit. Loved the video. Up the Chels.
could have mentioned about the battery life...
Dude is rich.
"I think Marques is one of the few dudes on YouTube that can flex without looking like an asshole 😂😉. Belated wishes, man! Good stuff as always!"
"I would say the 15 pro max is probably one of the bad iphone out there. I bought 15 pro max like mid November and since then I have replaced 3 phones. I was experiencing top earpiece speaker buzzing issue you can’t notice it while watching videos but when you are calling someone body on a loud speaker it is extremely noticeable and its not only me after researching I can saying this is one of the common issue with this phone. After the replacement I have started to feel network issue, went to apple and the phone failed hardware test, they reply my phone and its the 3rd one and I was expecting the same issue, I compared the speed with my friends 14 pro max the difference way huge, so I went to apple to test my 3rd phone and it failed again, the amount of stress they I have gone through in last 1.5 months is crazy. After failing 3rd time I don’t have the courage to give it a try one more time. Just to add I’m living in UK so who ever is buying phone in UK please ask them test the network for you. All the things I am experiencing other people are experiencing as well so be aware and do research."
"Hi guys, I would like ur advice: I currently have the iPhone XR from way back. It is still working fine, battery is at 75% of what it used to be, I don't really have complaints. But this is mostly due to the fact that I am very careful with my stuff. I am thinking to buy thee iPhone 15pro because..... I can? Is that a good reason? I feel like I am punishing myself from getting a new phone because I am so careful with the one I have.
What do you guys think?"
Does anyone known what apps that show weather in this video?
Damn you bought 911 Turbo S... congrats ❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉
FC Barcelona ❤💙
❤
can we talk about the battery on the 15 PRO because i feel like its a downgrade from the older phones
Will expect 3 month use of Pixel 8 pro
"I went from IPhone X to the 13 pro max. 
Great phone also!"
Very nice.
Anyone else notice the girl in his camera pictures at 6:41 ..??   🤔
"Weird colours seem off on this video, and not as sharp as usual"
WORST VIDEO HE HAS EVER MADE .
"My favorite Action button is a short cut list…I have it mapped to do 7 things: open Alarms, turn on/off flashlight, open camera and take 3 photos, record sound, take a video, turn silent mode on, turn silent mode off. I love these!!!"
"Didn't expect that FC Barcelona shirt, love that you are becoming a football fan. Awesome"
3:40 no shame
"Ios 15 on iphone 13 pro was the best.
Ios 16 n 17 fucjed up and super buggy, cause the new unprepared Dynamic stupid useless island. They should fix it n make it smooth back like ios 15 on iphone 13 pro max."
Gimme one
The first thing I noticed in this video was that it was taken on the iPhone 15 pro in cinematic mode... the video is so bright and the hair is so blurry
Barca soo broke. How are they affording Marcus?
OMG you look soo good in FCB t shirt ❤❤❤
"Wow, shot on 15 pro !!! It looked so good !!!"
Barcelona interesting !
Been using it for 2 months. Upgraded from 11. Best experience 🔥
"30 😳😳😳😳 
You are really not look like 30 years old man"
I want apple to remove the island when i use the torch light…
the last bit...all shot on the very phone he is talking about.......i could hear the till noise ringing at that moment lol
"for those who has an old iphones trust me its time to upgrade i've had an iphone xs max and now upgraded to iphone 15 pro max and i love it whether its built quality, camera, usb c, 10 to 14.5 hours battery life , and also an action button i just love it and i'm not going to upgrade until i see like such big improvement to the iphone."
"Loving the plot twist, great long-term review! 📱👍"
"I was originally planning on buying the 15 Pro Max this year, but I didn't, I decided to buy the S23 Ultra, not that I wanted to, but I had no other choice because the sales of the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max phones were not great, because I live in India. So I thought to myself forget about the 15 Pro Max, and just wait for the 16 Pro Max next year which is rumored to have an interesting design which I'm looking forward to. Now the only reason I bought the S23 Ultra, was because my base iPhone 14's Software got crashed so I had no choice but to buy a new phone, but I'm really looking forward to both S24 Ultra and iPhone 16 Pro Max"
Patiently waiting for the Turbo S review on AutoFocus now 😅
Marques I paused the video 3 times to adjust my monitor because I thought I messed up the settings. All that only for you to drop it was all shot on a 15 Pro hahahaha nicely played!
Gonna need a full video on the 911!
the only phone ive returned. years behind android
Love your videos but please lose the Barça T-shirt cause it's bad publicity lately 😂
"Name of this weather app, please?"
"Marques please do a what’s on my phone video! Glad to see Copilot on there, love that app."
MKBHD aim a Barca shirt ❤️💙
Just upgraded from an XR to a 15pro. My Xr headset speaker started to die. Setting it up now while watching this 😂
im loving the barca kit💙❤️
this video is the reason humane ai pin will never work…. phones are just good and do what they say on the tin…. no chat gpt shortcut for MKB…. bc it doesnt add too much value….
pls do same for one plus fold phone
"Marques in a football shirt was not on my 2023 bingo card, love that."
Ohh! with a barca jercy!! it's so cool 😶‍🌫
Crop and Action button are the things I use.  I use it to turn on the light and it’s used A LOT at night when I need to go to my 2 year old’s room and bring her something.
hala madrid
4:23 double click in the power button!!!!! Why is this not an option???
Awesome Barcelona jersey!
why is my iphone 11's camera flash absolutely fucked to deal with to turn flash on you have to press down arrow up the top and then press flash on and it works but then next pic you take the flash isnt on anymore and then sometimes that arrow is gone so yuo cant even chose to have flash on
"I don't really see myself going to back into the Apple ecosystem now, but I definitely think this is one of those generalist phones that you can recommend to anyone who's not looking for something complicated."
Loving the Barca jersey
congrats on the Porsche! And hitting 30!
Honestly honest review youtuber
Want to give this video two likes one for the content and another one for the jersey ✌️
The end is epic. It literally made me go back and watch it again. Damn! This quality from a phone 😲
happy birth day
MKBHD is just the Tech guy the whole world needs!
There’s some apps out there that will convert your spatial videos to 3d SBS so you can watch them on a VR headset or “AR”glasses like the rokid max. That’s what I’ve been doing the past couple weeks 🤓
"the colours and highlights looked funky from the beginning, no surprise it was shot on the 15. Should've recorded in log Marques."
who else gagged in the end when he said this was all shot on the iphone?
Barca will win the champions league 😂
dang. lemme save up and upgrade from my iphone 11
You’re wearing the best t-shirt ever ❤
What's with the contrast in this video?
Watch this from 15 pro
Barcelona baby
the ending shock me ><<
Noticed that there is something off about this video and at last he mentioned shot on iPhone 🙃
I love Marques but Hala Madrid!
"Hi, does anyone know what's the name of that weather app at minute 6.26? Thanks"
Nice review…and beautiful shirt!
Congratulations on the Porsche 🎉
Im expecting an “Ive been married for almost two weeks now” some day 😂
Notice every year “ this iphone is wayy better “ this man is scared to be like his old self i love him but boy i miss the htc days mkhb when he was not holding his tongue back
I made a toggle to skipp to the next song while i hold my  phone on my pocket while walking !
Great video as always that’s a clean end also very clean indeed…….. and a next thing what’s the name of that weather app tho @mkbhd
I think the double tap on the back is faster and more convenient for camera
Thank you for buying a Porche and not a Mclaren like every other youtuber. Real drives know ❤
I was not trading my iPhone 14 pro max for this. This iphone feels cheap in the hand i went to see it and the colors and texture to it is dull in person. Looks like plastic spray painted.. also i dont like the action button
my man is a barcelona fan😍
What rucksack is it in the video?
Wtf I did not expect that last part. Now I am more confident to record with my prores on my phone.
"iPhone,the best of the best👍🏻🙏🏻"
Yeah aps-c cameras are pretty pointless for content creation at this point
Are you wearing a Barcelona shirt. As a Real Madrid supporter I’m coming after you.
"The fact that this entire video was shot on the 15 pro is just mind blowing. The cameras are the only thing that inspire me to get an iphone. Unfortunately, that's not enough."
Deadset didn't think you shot the video on an iPhone
Mes que un club❣
"Low end device 😢 putting a lot of time and effort on editing, but getting no views 😭"
"C'mon Marques. Lose the ""!"" in the titles. We're all adults here."
That 911 reveal though 😍 goals
Are you still getting over heating issues?
Dam that was shot on an Iphone got me.
Wallpaper  anyone ?
"No case is fine, but no screen protector is just nuts to me"
what about fingerprints on the titanium sides
The GOAT
dislike for barça
30? Dude you look 30 est 2013.
"Right from the beginning, i knew it was being shot on an iPhone... it's very noticeable."
Weather app name pls!
was the audio strait from the phone?
Am i the only one who is seeing barca kit?
The best time to upgrade is when you need to. I may upgrade in a few months from an iPhone 8 plus. Nothing at all about battery issues that seem to plague a lot of 15 pro users?
We're the same! I too never use a screen guard or back cover.
MUUUCHACHOSSSSS
cool car bro
Swiping on the Dynamic Island just gets finger prints and grease on the camera all the time and any photo or video call look blurry and I always have to keep a microfibre cloth handy to clean it.
Spatial video was available on the Nintendo 3DS
"Been going for a month with the pro max and so far I’m loving this phone way too much, the one caveat I got(coming from a Oneplus 10t) is charging, 27w compared to 125w is crazy slow to me now that I was used to the oneplus, however, battery does last 1.5-2x as much as the oneplus even from the beginning, so it’s almost making the charge speed even out"
You should do one for Samsung
Your 30?? DAMN
Now let's film this with pixel AI video boost and compare...
"It would be cool if the action button has single tap, double tap, thriple tap and long press."
"My action button…..

In portrait orientation if I click the action button in work focus mode I get a list to choose to call my family & work friends , open Google & Apple Maps ,

When I get home focus mode automatically changes & the action button now activates a different menu for controlling my smarthome, 

In Any focus mode if the phone is upside down and I click the action button it turns on’ do not disturb, (as I’m putting phone in pocket)

When removing phone from pocket when I click the action button again it prompts a list asking me what focus mode I want to select.

If im in travel focus mode the action button launches the camera.

When I’m in home focus, clicking the action button with phone orientation landscape left toggles the kitchen light between mood, 100% on & off,
Landscape right does the toggle for lounge lights,
Face up toggles garden lights & face down toggles upstairs lights.

It’s endless what you can do ."
What's with the Barcelona shirt?
marques recorded this wo months ago and now he is posting it🤣🤣🤣
This video is an Ad. An unnecessary one.
Was this shot with an anamorphic lens on the iPhone?
"I don't understand how you scratch your screen like that. I've never used a screen protector on any of my phones, including the plastic screen of the Palm Pre and I think I've had one single scratch on all of my smartphone screens since 2007. Currently rocking my iPhone 15 Pro Max since launch with no screen protector. Not even a micro scratch."
Oh man! Barca jersey. This is hard to take.
does anyone know what weather app he uses?
im waiting for the studio video showing the bts of this video
Thumbs up for the Porsche 911 turbo
"Thank you for this review after 3 months of usage, I always watch your videos and learn English at the same time 😂😂 Greating from DR."
Make a 3 months later video of the Google Pixel 8 Pro
What weather app was that
Congrats on the Turbo S! Thats my favorite car!
damn. i didnt even realize the whole video was shot on iphone
The casual 911 flex was classy.
Marquees X Barca <3
Are you a barcelona fan?
"Best way is to map the action button to do multiple things depending what screen orientation the phone is at, 
My action button can do over 20 different things & prompt a list of my choice for more options, it’s literally endless what you can do , it’s great."
Marques is a Culer?
Marques… we need to talk about your football jerseys… (even if im quite sure you have that bcn shirt because its probably the drake edition but still…)
Dude huge congrats on the 911!!
"Now I can confirm MKBHD is completely sold to Apple Inc. Had my suspicion he was an Apple fan boy, but now I have confirm it."
what is that weather app
😅 Happy 30 Marques 🎉 🙌
FC Barcelona!!! I never thought marques was a barca fan!
Don't put your phone in pocket bro ❤
Iphone 11 has horizontal alignment of the main and wide camera lens...
What’s the weather widget called?
"Still watching on my god ol' trusty iPhone 8 plus, still waiting for my iPhone 16 to come. Even more slightly better and more slightly refined)
Recently done a repairment on my own. Changed headphone speaker and battery as well. Brand spankin' new 😎"
i think this whole A roll video was taken by iPhone 15 Pro😅
"This one hit it, last year's, previous... Always more rice 🍚"
"Great video as always Marques, thoroughly enjoyed it from beginning all the way until the end. Keep up the good work."
Barcaaa !!! 😍
Apart from the real content I really love it when you wear FC Barcelona kit❤
That's why I was wondering why this video looks so much sharper(smartphone camera sharpness) than usual.
Are you a Barcelona fan???
"Honestly a glowing review, so tempted! Ive got a 12 pro and im still really happy with it, plus i really dig the more hard edged design, 15 is getting dangerously close to too rounded for my liking"
nothing new in iphone also and their is nothing new
"(we) need a complete review of 992 turbo S, the reason of this choice, quirks and features of a petrrol engine. go go go flat. out....."
I travel constantly internationally and use the action button to bring up Google Translate for when I cannot think of a word. Incredibly useful.
A Porsche 911 is boring and not flashy? In what world?!
A little bit more of money for the end of the year: the video
Noo noo Marques Noo barca. Be a Madrid fan
What s with Barca jersey ?
992 Turbo? Good man
What bothers me the most is spending $1500 for something you have to coddle because in honesty iPhone users are always protecting their phones even the battery life there’s all these tips . Why can’t these companies release something meant to be used heavily on the daily
"I have the 2nd Gen. iPhone SE, and for the most part, loving it, but there are rumors for a big update, including the body of the next SE, I would love a 15, but I kind of see what Apple does for the SE4🤔"
"Wooow! I always said that Apple is kind of like Porsche, glad you have one now in your driveway. 

Also - shot on iPhone? Pretty neat looking video 😎"
I used this (at the starting) wallpaper 4 years ago...idk it felt nostalgic....
The best action button shortcut for me is to open the Apple TV remote control. It works really well and it's really useful if your actual remote is far away
"I must say, the video quality did look super crisp. To the extent that I had noticed it while the video was playing. And before you even mentioned what it had been shot on!"
THIS WAS SHOT ON AN IPHONE BRO IT LOOKED LIKE A NORMAL VIDEO YOU'D TYPICALLY MAKE?????
I love Barcelona outfit u rocking
Marques on September 2024 : I've been using the airpods max 2 for 15 years and here's how I feel about them 💀
"A Porsche 911 for Your 30th Birthday, not too shabby, quite impressive actually 😂 Happy Birthday Marques 😎👍"
VISCA BARCA
The iPhone 11 Smart Battery Case has a button for acess the camera and the spot of the button is perfect
What weatherapp do you use in your iphone15pro. The red &black colors?
When he said this entire video was shot on an iPhone.. I was like DAMNNNN
You are turning into Messi lol🤣
Help Barcelona economy 😅😅😅
The video is especially beautiful
I use the button to open a automation folder 'menu'' opening! super handy and super customizable.
"Android Fans to Apple:Do you Use USB-C??
Apple:Nah
EU:You Will....😂😂😂"
Waiting for the Pixel 8 3 months review!
"I think I'm spending too many hours viewing your videos, I noticed straight away that's smoghing wrong with the image quality. And at the end of the video you just confirmed my doubts."
"I knew from the first second on that this was shot on an iPhone. It is pretty visible when you're looking at Marquess's skin colour and grainy detail which you don't see in a camera with a bigger lense. Still, they've got some great cinematographer, but still prefer the footage from the Red-Cameras."
Who can buy me iphone 15 pro? I'm still on my iphone 7 and need the upgrade badly...
Are you a Barcelona fan? 🤔
Wait are you a barca fan?
for some reason I knew that this video was shot using the iphone's camera.
"Great vid, Loved everything about it. And congrats too!!🎉"
happy birthday bro!
Well congrats on the new car
"Guys, please note that you can't record spatial video for the Apple vision Pro on the regular 15!"
Finally you did it. Shot the mkbhd vid with iphone. 👏🏾
twist
"Why you repeat the specs…as you first haded it on. 
Just tell your overall experience."
where is the robot🦾 cinematic shots ?
i am annoyed by the white noise in the background
Wow I still was shocked this was shot with an iPhone.
BARCA MENTIONED ❤💙
"Didn't expect seeing him in a Barcelona jersey tbh I thought I was seeing things for a second. It looks good 👍 on him too. American stereotypes getting demolished 😅
FORCA BARCA!"
whats that advertisement weather app you got there?
Its a scam that the regular iphone 15 has a 60hz display and 2.5 usb-c. I wont upgrade my iphone xr until the regular iPhone comes with those
the plot that happens to my mind when he sayed that it was shot by an iphone..... insine
WANNA SEE A 911 REVIEW!
Hey Marques! Can you do the same thing with Pixel 8 Pro?
"I’m still using an iPhone 11 Pro, will wait until iPhone 16 comes out :)
That porsche is amazing, congrats ;)"
"Are you wearing Barcelona's jersey 😮
Seriously 😅"
Does it still have the overheating issue or has that now been fixed?
Can I get the wallpaper please?
"What do you think about battery? With my iPhone 15 max pro I feel it’s draining very fast, compared to iPhone 13 max pro. Does not last a day."
"why does it feel like when Marques said that the airpods max is due for an update, means that he already has been testing one?"
Why does this video exist? Nothing really changed within 3 months.
I love the way you get paid to plug products. Send me some money too!
Apple is not going to make anything consumer friendly unless they are forced to because their coustomers are that stupid that are not even able to realise that you have been paid by them in some capacity
Where is battery review
Please make for Iphone 15 PLUS
"I’m most interested in the stereoscopic potential. 
The comment that the actual video isn’t all that impressive unless the subject is within 3 feet or so, is disheartening and kind of understandable. 

Firstly, I’m not sure if Mr Brownlee is a fan of 3D video or photography. If so, one might throughly enjoy a 3D shot with loads of depth but limited pop-out. But if one defines the potential or enjoyment solely by how much the subject stands out, that’s worthwhile information but maybe not the best way for a 3D geek to decide whether to pull the trigger. 

I was also disappointed, although I get why one might choose to leave this unexplored, that Mr B says the only way to view the 3D video is with the upcoming headset. 

I’ve been looking forward to reports of video conversion software which would allow a user to watch 3D videos from an iPhone via 3D projectors, TV’s, etc. 
I’m hearing those rumblings and am trying not to lose my mind. But I am soooo excited."
Wrapping up with the same Porsche argument that you started the first 15 Pro with. 😏
There is app Spatialify that converts Spatial video for AVision to other 3D formats.
marque if you shot spatial video and able to put your own in vision pro then you have the vision pro with you and testing it??? It means vision pro will launch in about 2 weeks or less or they just gave you for review/testing for a while only. Which one is it? @mkbhd
"Give us a 2 year later review, and talk about software updates, performance, and battery health"
I find that linking a button to the camera makes it open the app on accident without realizing it is open unnecessarily easy and this will drain battery. I unlinked it again.
what is the weather app called
Great T-Shirt man
"Why are you not taking about the green screen issue over ios update in iPhone?

If you talk it will put three issue to apple's notice."
"The recurring Apple fanboy video. Talking about things that won't change, Marques, will not stop praising Apple for doing absolutely nothing to improve and basking in the trillion-dollar sunshine and ripping millions off."
Barça 🥶
Happy to see MKBHD is a Barca fan
Unbelievable 😂😂 I’m even watching 360p on my iPhone XS it looks amazing
"Happy Birthday! I wish Apple would give customers an option to purchase an iPhone with the same glass that’s on the higher end, Apple Watches ? 🤷🏾‍♂️ Another outstanding video"
Unbelievable 😂😂
The end of this video🔥🔥🔥🔥 i swapped from android to the 15 PM because of you!!! thanks for the videos!!!
Shot on iPhone 15 Pro. Bombshell at the end. Unexpected. Couldn’t tell. Wow.
"The ending, essential!"
Marquez is a culer but disguising all this while😂
Use ur car with good health! All the best!
Why theres a ryzen zen3 cpu lying on the desk? Those has pins right?
Another very good video. The only thing I don’t like about Marques’ videos is that here and there he is wearing a Barcelona jersey or coat and I support Real Madrid 😅
"1. ""Shot on iPhone""
2. Pause and transparency shortcut is kinda great for mapping it to the action button (I use AirPods Pro 2 but hated conversational awareness)

3. I think the iPhone 15 lineup is kinda underrated, it is already much better compared to other iPhone updates in recent years"
off the bat this is shot on phone
you are 30? you look like you just turned 21
Pro tip: You don’t need the Apple Vision Pro to watch spatial videos. You can watch them on any VR headset using any decent video playing app.
Belated Happy Birthday MKBHD
The 15 pro max is insane. I’m loving it!
Using the Garuda Linux wallpaper. Nice!
"I switched from an iPhone 8 to an iPhone 15 pro. At the same time, I bought my first Apple Watch with Celluar. The iPhone is faster and I have built my evening routine for the Action Button, which is very helpful. But it remains an iPhone, the Apple Watch impresses me more, probably because I never had one before. Now I use my new iPhone even less and am often out and about with just the Watch and the AirPods pro. If I had known this beforehand, I would have bought an iPhone SE."
"so that's why the USB-C shot was low-res, it was a zoomed in clip. unlike you usual videos where everything is nice & sharp."
"I wish they had kept the titanium frame in the natural color on the black model, I’m missing the nice contrast the iPhone 4 had between the back and the sides."
I personally think they didn't release spatial video recording in non pro models coz they didn't have the LIDAR sensor
What’s the weather app at 6:28 ?
"I was suspecting that this was not filmed with the usual large spherical lens as I noticed the background blur or bokeh looked weird in the main talking head portion, while looking great in the other more close-up shots. It looks like the blur is much more strongly applied vertically, so vertical lines (such as on the mkbhd logo on the Mia robot and the vertical lines in the door frame) stay sharp while everything else is blurred but again in a sort of unnatural ""directional"" way. I was actually thinking of an anamorphic lens at first, but I knew that something was off anyway at this point and since this is all about the new phone I was suspicious. So then I started focusing on the hair which is where usually the edge detection mistakes will reveal that the blurring is faked. I must say, it was really really hard to spot, only when really really pixel peeping you start to notice small bits of hair that are blurred that shouldn't be, but I would never notice if I wasn't looking for it (granted, I'm watching on my phone, not on a large high resolution monitor). Even when I did see it, I was actually really on the fence if that could be just compression artifacts instead, and it honestly could still be. 
So even knowing the final detail you revealed in the end, and knowing that I felt like something was off, I'm very impressed with how far the quality has come. Some other details where I knew something was off were that in the POV shot I felt like the camera moved in smaller quicker movements than the usual heavy large camera would, and I felt like there were a lot more ""gimbal shots"" than usual as well as the shot that you would usually do with the robot now felt like a manual gimbal move"
That Barça shiiirt dooooooope
"I'm confused between iPhone 15 pro and S23 ultra (or upcoming s24 ultra). I've always used Android phones and had used iPhone 6s for less than a year.

I see too many missing features in iOS like call recording, file sharing to any computer with a USB wire and much more such small tiny stuff.

Though my most usage is capturing photos and videos. I feel photos are good with Samsung already but iPhone wins all the time with videos. 


Hence it confuses me, as I want best video captures. Someone please suggest your ideas, thoughts, experiences!"
"Forget about the phone, when’s the 911 video coming out?"
forca barca didnt think u follow football
"I may be old and grumpy, but I never thought videos shot on a phone would be so good that one would be very surprised when someone said ""This entire video was shot on a phone"". No more potato quality videos... Awesome!"
Was waiting for this one bro❤
I'm very afraid for what the adult industry has in store for us when the vision pro comes out.
my favorite YouTuber wearing my favorite team dress  🖤
BARCA fans 😂
That wallpaper brings back memories
Preordered it & got it on launch day. It’s been a great phone. Nice video
Made an entire video only for flex the 911 matte black ❤ 9:50
"Marques, loved the video. I have a suggestion, I think a Real Madrid jersey would suit you better"
"Do NOT buy it! Selfies are WORSE than my S22 Ultra, bugs are all over the place and mid quality indoor shots. I really regret every penny that i spend 🤦🏻‍♂️"
You got an 911??!! Congratulations 🎉
When you mean shot on iPhone. Does it include the sound ?
"bro made a video about his iphone just to tell that he is thirty now and he got himself a 911 
anyways happy bday to the best tech advisor and reviewer"
My favorite tech guy is a Barcelona fan!
"lol, that Apple act at the end was so awesome!
Still holding on to my 13 Pro and waiting for the 16 Pro, though."
9:20 damnn bro you are really making me spend those 1000$ 😝 & finally upgrade from my humble iPhoneX
Man.. you gotta be a real narcissist to be an influencer eh!
I love those dramatic zoom in and zoom out  after some statements hehe very well placed👍🏽🤗👏🏽
upgrading from the base iphone 12 to the 15 pro max. wow the difference is nice
Is it worth upgrading from 14 pro max to 15 pro max?
The best option for the action button for me is nothing because I have adhd and pressing it over and over again is stress reducing
"4:22 Why do you have Garuda Linux wallpaper??
And a Windows wallpaper on Mac!!"
what is the name of that weather app?
Truly enjoyed this video! I would also love the long term review of the Google Pixel 8 Pro & it should also be recorded with the phone
"the iphone 15 pro really makes me think of switching from android to ios, currently got the s10+ and over the years since i bought it no other android phone made me buy it, was thinking of getting the s24 ultra but seeing the leaks really doesnt impress me, again the same design, they gonna remove the 10x zoom lens for a 5x, and then you have the bad optimisation of android compared to ios, example would be using the dji app for the osmo stabilizers, on android you are limited to the functions you can perform also video quality is worse while the iphone works perfectly, you can have the best damn android with the best specs ever and will still be limited and will never use all that performance, its sad really, google should really split android into two and have one for cheap phones and one for flagships so then app makers will have an easier time making apps and will just ignore making them for cheap phones"
"Having app settings located outside of the app itself is still a thorn in the flesh that Apple has yet to refine since it's first gen induction. On another note, I could easily tell this video was shot in an iPhone from the beginning because of it's trademark ""Smooth Yellow Apple Skintone"" look..."
Barcelona kit.?? I Will send you RM 😅
"I am always curius why he does not review ""max""es"
How did you get such clear shots? what are your settings? I would really appreciate if you could share with me.
"As a lefty, the action button is in prime positioning."
Hearing that the whole video was shot on iPhone 15 Pro was a surprise for me. 😮😮 Always watch videos is 1440 or 2160 but quality didn't seem to come out of a Mobile Phone
Wao still rocking that wallpaper
"congrats on 30! welcome to your 4th decade. How is a ""Porsche"" not flashy?"
The quality of this video is amazing 😍😮
I love the battery life.  I charge my phone every 36 hours i would say.
lol. nothing new. s23 ultra > next 5 generations of iphone
Almost threw up when i saw that Barca to 🤮
"no mention of all the massive amounts of USB devices you can connect?  like keyboard, mouse, monitor, hard drives, controllers all through usb-c at the same time?"
"we all notice the guy with the dog at 6:14 , right ?"
Interesting about the video is being shot on an iPhone was I noticed the lack of the familiar eyes looking up to a display mounted on a camera as with the usual videos.
It was extremely disappointing when you didnt put the phone in pocket and started saying THISS is Porche 911 GT(w/e) and in fact it is MYY Porche 911 GT(RS)
Real Madrid shirt would be nice .
Me watching this on my iPhone 15
Barcelona!!!!!
Força Barça
"Jaw dropped at ""Every shot is taken with Iphone 15 pro of this video"" 🔥"
"Please make a Behind the Scene video about the making of this video 🙏
And then publish it on the Studio Channel 🙏"
"Iphone 15 series sales dipped after  3 months. Tim approached MKBHD for a 3 month review, and bang the graph raised again!

Next is the limited edition red shit from apple, and the stupid fanboys will flood their stores!"
I change my iPhones every 3 years so it’s time next year to say goodbye to my beloved iPhone 13 mini and to welcome an iPhone 16 Pro in my life. That will be my first Pro version and I’m looking forward to it. Still dreaming of an iPhone mini Pro though…!
THEY DID IT! They did the thing!
Why the pro not the max? The pro doesn't have new periscope camera so whatever was said about the 14 pro is true here. The pro max would been more interesting.
HALAMADRID
VISCA BARCA MARQUES
6 / 12 mo would be even greater hehehe. Nice video tho!
"W review 
L jersey"
Hello! Could anyone tell me what backpack is that at 5:54?
"Dangling over the stairs mentioning haven’t dropped it yet is such a tease, or invitation to disaster! 😂"
Amazing video - love the new car! Agree with everything you said. I just upgraded from my iPhone 13 Pro to the 15 Pro Max and I really appreciate all the fine adjustments in making this the best iPhone to use yet. I am too not so mad about the 3 focual lengths on the single camera but may use them the odd time now and again. Love the ending of this how you shot it it entirely on iPhone.. just like the apple event haha! Great job and Happy New Year when it comes MKBHD team!
"My brother made it, got the holy grail of cars in matte black. Congratulations Marques ❤"
"Europe: ""You are welcome, Marques"""
"When MKBHD said him using the the Vision Pro wasn’t him flexing, what he meant was the real flex is the Porsche at the end🤣 congrats 🙌🏾"
Iphone 15 pro is the definite iPhone of the mobile phone market.
Does Marques support Barcelona or does he just like the Jersey?😛
"I wonder how much battery health % Marques usually end up with after using a Pro iPhone for a full year, every year..."
Up Barca🥴🥴
That wallpaper bring old memories back
911!!!!! You made it :)
"Great stuff, neat, precise and concise."
A Barca kit? 😳😳😳
MKBHD is a Barcelona fan ?
"Hey Marques, I have iPhone 7 Plus. Should I upgrade? 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣"
Forca Barca❤
MKBHD with a Barça shirt deserves a like! 👍
"First thing I said to myself as soon as the video started was ""that's brighter than usual"""
Big takeaway: you can use Google assistant on iPhone 😱
Nice chick @6:41 :D
8:50 what!!! 😮 Why in the world does no one know about this??
nice jersey marques
The iPhone 15 Pro Max's screen seems less sensitive compared to the iPhone 11. Try pressing a key continually on the keyboard and you'll notice it lags every now and then. Anybody else noticed that?
"What’s the name of that weather app, please?"
Loved the comparison with Porsche 911. Still my favourite car to date  over last 40 years and there is a reason it still sells so well
I want USB-C but I just upgraded last year and don't plan on upgrading this year. Maybe I'll wait for iPhone 17 or 18
I am sure this is a paid review without disclosure.
which weather app is that?
But how about the battery?
"The upgrade sweet spot will be the 16 rather than 15 for people that want an AI assistant, anyone with a 15 won’t have access."
"visca el barca, nice shirt."
Ma boy on the fcb shirt
Which weather app is that at 9:10 ?? looks so good
I'm glad you got that Barcelona jersy
"I was thinking who cares about the video when you're using a $25k filming rig, but then you got me at the end. If I ever end up having to film some stuff, I'd rather get an iPhone."
great barça shirt
"Hi Mark, can you say the N word in the next video?"
"Am just wondering when phones start being released every 2 years. Literally all these features are getting more and more ""meh"" now."
"Not sure if the audio was also captured on the iPhone 15, but I did notice a background hiss which I don't normally notice and that was before the big reveal at the end"
"My friend has put together a control center that he can access with the new power button. For example, at the top there is the mute button and so on"
"The light is too harsh on ur face where sunlight is falling, lighting isn’t soft like before"
Why the Barcelona Jersey though?
love the jersey tho 👌🏻
"this is a great review. thanks for this. I also set my action button to the camera from day one. I don’t see a need to change it. 
setting the phone to mute/unmute is now a few more steps but I like the trade off. 

USB-C is the only reason I upgraded. However, after the upgrade I found other useful features"
It's kinda nice that Auba featuring in this channel.
Bro... Why barcelona...?
"Damnm, that leadup to the 911 flex... nice"
what about battery life ? why you didn't mention that part ???
my jaw dropped when you said this entire video was shot on iphone
Not upgrading until there's a mini :P
"All I've learnt, is what I knew before: the action button is inconvenient for anyone who wants to keep it for silencing notifications. I'm sure I'll get used to it being there, but for now it's the 'not volume up' button above the volume up button"
Mate black 911 review please 😅
Why Google assistant on an iphone instead of Siri?
"I always updated my phone every time my contract finished. Up until the iPhone X. I decided to see how long I could live with it, it’s starting to show it’s age now so the iPhone 16 will probably be my next."
I Love my 15 Pro Max Titanium Natural
Geat video to end 2023 with ❤❤❤
"entire video, i was thinking to myself, why does the video look odd, your facial hair sharpened, surrounding colour and tone different... end answered it, it was shot on iPhone."
MKBHD becoming Ijustine but afraid to be
Opening camera with action buttons seems useless. Its much better to swipe on left to open camera while in lock screen. Faster than reaching that weirdly placed action button.
Congratultaions on your birthday!
FCBHD in the house!! 😂
Congrats!!! 🎉
Visca Barca
I love how he becomes like a movie narrator whenever he brings the Porsche 911 into this.
FC Barcelona easter egg?
MKBHD like that Barca shirt 👊
visca barca❤💙
Great video MKBHD and smartphones are so cool :]
"The best tech mastermind. The whole concept, script, references, honesty & that Easter egg… you are brilliant Marques"
"Smth is off with the sound in this video. It goess ""shhhhhhhhhh"" all the time. Once you've heard it, it is ruined"
Wow🎉
"Camera quality is really good, i thought that you are filming this video on your red camera"
the last part got me
Why do I have the feeling that Apple didn’t meet the expected sales level for iPhone 15 s the same way they did for previous versions ? 🤔
6:13 DOGGIE
❤
CAN PLS SOMEONE LMK WHAT WEATHER APP IS HE USING ???
My question is did you do more work or less in production of this video as compared to using your normal setup?
Happy birthday and congratulations on the Porsche :)
Holy shit you got a Turbo S?!
"Those cuts are werid, never had them on mine and ill never use screen protectors"
*it's usb 3.0 and not 3.2
It was pretty obvious this was shot on a smartphone
"10:17 I was waiting to hear that, you can’t fool us that easily Marques, we’ve grown too accustomed to the smoothness of the RED cameras. Even with that in mind for most of this video, I had doubts when the shot types changed but it really does look great. Now I’m just curious what camera app was used and how long it took to edit"
So much flexing in this video!!! 😉😊 I guess most men who know anything about cars have dreamt about driving a Posche 911!! at some point in life! More power to you MKBHD!
Random Barça shirt is a surprise to be sure but a welcomed one
Forca Barca
"Flex after Flex😂, As always a living inspiration 🤍"
W Barca jersey
"I'm still using a one+7 pro. It's been amazing for years but my next phone will be an iPhone, because I have all Apple products besides my phone and I'm a photographer. With all this in mind is the iPhone 15 pro the right choice when I'll still do most of my shooting on my proper camera"
"2K24 Eve almost here, Best content production mutal with my interests on YT"
"Was shot on iphone 15 its like the end of a horror movie ""Based on a true Story"""
"I'm not lying, I knew from the very beginning of the video, it was shot on iPhone, I really know their color profile and the skin tone adjustment on your skin, not surprised that you pull the same thing as what apple did."
they keep selling us the same crap for higher price each year. Smartphones peaked good 5 years ago.
my action button opens spotify lol
nice video...but i am curious what happened to the other  studio  DOG His name was MAC or something??
I also have the regular iphone 15 pro and i find myself using my phone less than when i had my android
Great review like always. Finally watching this with my 15pro
dislike the jersey brother
Hi
"THE SHIRTTTTTTT

BARCAA LESGOOO"
Nice Jersey Marques😉
The FC Barcelona jersey was a nice touch. Visca Barça.
"As someone who is about to fully commit to buying a recording rig for my 15 Pro, that outro fully bolstered my confidence!"
3:35 chat je pète
Unbelievable until you say it last.
That porsche is looking sooo clean
I am a fan of you. Can i buy your iphone 15 pro..as a remembrance
Barca ❤️💙
"@mkbhd, u got a 911 as a birthday gift?"
"No reason to believe me but, I knew right from the start: this video was shot on iphone."
"🔥 Hot take: Solid black phones and cases are the best, because they reflect the least when taking photos through a window. Fingerprints be damned. 😉"
Bro just made a 10 minute video talking about an iphone then mention he had a Porsche like it's a secondary subject
"From a car guy that follows you for years now, my sincere congratulations getting the Porsche! 👏🏼"
Double tapping the power button is for quick camera access.
911 is “boring” 😂😂😂
How does he not drop his phone ?! These phoned are so slippery. I drop mine about 3 times a week.
I wish the button could been used to play pause and skip ⏭️ ⏮️.
"I’m yet to see any real reason to go from a 13PM to a 15PM except the USB-C but as mentioned, you still need the lightning cable for other devices so well…"
"Happy Belated  30th Birthday Marques, may you continue to carve the path not yet trodden and continue to inspire many all whilst enjoying every moment.
 
🎂🎂🎂🎂🎂🎂🎂🎂🎂🎂🎂

""All shot on an iPhone!?""  as an android user I might make the switch.
😳"
NICE SHIRT!!! VISCA BARCA!!
I watched this on my iPhone 15 pro max. It’s a sweet phone.
Is MKBHD a Football Club Barcelona fan?
Marques you are wearing the wrong team jersey man! 😂😂 --- would be cool a video about the new bernabeu and the crazy technology behind it ;)
would love to watch the behind the scenes footage of this video.
"I also have the action button mapped for camera, I was driving and wanted to make a quick shot of something, couldn’t reach that mf with one hand 🥲"
Using this phone just awesome for everything
CULER :)❤
"9:46
Marques is now 30 years of age ? really?
I thought 35 🤭
Happy Birthday 🎂  in Advance Marques"
@mkbhd can it be mapped to Shutter button
This whole video was just one big flex 💪🏾
i see youre barca fan instead of real madrid 🥲
Great video!!! Kudos to the entire team bts. 🤩
"I've just bought mine and the end of the video was like : ""This is a good year to switch"". I did feel relieved !"
"What type of weather app is it you're using, and appears in the video? Looks kinda cool!"
First I thought why the video look so weird ahhhh Iphone thats why
"I’m impressed, my guy filmed it on iphone 😮 crazy fire 🔥 I upgraded from the 11 and I agree this is the sweets pot this can literally last me another 8 only dropped three times, nothing crazy tho and still looks fresh"
I chose black titanium. Matches with almost all cases because Black. And the camera is the only reason I bought it for. Love it!
Not being able to tell if it was shot on Red or an iPhone is insane
"This time i could sort of tell that this was shot on an iPhone because at multiple times in the video, the phone was out of focus and your face was the only thing in focus. That doesn't happen with your regular RED camera setup."
"About action bottom, setting up to take photo is much obvious ..."
Great jersey 🎉🙌
Adam was wearing the new AirPod Max when he passed
"I have this weird character where when everyone around me is convincing me to get an iphone, i will find more reasons not to. 

Idk why. 

So android, samsung, google, xiaomi better do something about it."
Porsche review?
"Tell him someone that it cant be nothing easier than swipe left to open the camera, dont need to long press or search the button"
"I have been a HARDCORE Samsung fan my whole life. Almost a fanatic. But since your initial review of the 15, it has been giving me a serious crisis of faith."
But why not double click power button for camera?
👍🏻
Still using iphone x. Cheers
"clearly makeout the video shot on iphone from the start, btw sick matte black porsche"
But what is that weather app???
6:13 What the dog doing?
Another legend joined Barcelona ♥️💙
Where is your office dogs update 2023?
Hi we don't do PHD in iPhone please tell general things about iphone
The beard really suits you!!
why Barca? 🥲🥲🥲
Mkbhd thanking EU for Usb C feels so nice. I can't wait for americans to discover meters and grams <3
Easter egg: Next long term review is gonna be Pixel 8? 02:15
Me still using iPhone XS Max 64gb bought in 2018 nov 11😂😢
"OHHH MYY GOD, I did NOT expect that at the end
Huge congratulations on the Turbo S!!! The 911 is one of my favourite cars, especially the GT3s, but recently I've started gaining more love for the Turbo S and now seeing that thing at the end made my jaw drop. It looks absolutely gorgeous and I am so happy to see that you bought it. Hope to see more videos with it in the future, maybe on this channel or maybe on AutoFocus.
And also hearing that this video was shot completely on the 15 Pro, that's incredible. Amazing work as always


And Belated Happy Birthday Marques!"
Blown away in the end. I watched the entire video again. 😂
Congrats on being 30. You are a real inspiration to us all. The Porsche looks sick.
The shot by iPhone part can be easily spotted from the over-sharpened image
Whaaaaat ? MKBHD is a Barcelona fan ?
no man you look like arsenal fan not barca 😮
Hey bro nice shirt.....tell more
You just need a REAL MADRID shirt man! And the video would be perfect
Finally made the switch this year to the 15pro. Loving it so far. Camera is just awesome. If only the battery was a bit more durable.
"Congratulations on the 911, at last you’ve got yourself a proper car!"
Hala Madrid 🤍
omg my fav YouTuber with Barca shirt <3
911 is not splashy. Oh man. LOL
"I thought the video didn't look as insanely perfect as usual, not surprised it was shot on the iPhone. I mean it still looks very very good, but it's obv not pro camera level"
love that barca jersey on you
Love the ending! Thank you for making me feel good about my purchase! Congratulations on the 911 and Happy Belated Birthday!
"hey, whats the name of the weather app at 6:26?"
marques are you change your mic?
bro got the dbrand 911
Unrelated; but why you never reviewed the ps5 slim?
can’t you believe you just got one of my dream car & the exact color I wanted ♾️
Don't you have any overheating when charging wireless in your tesla?
"Are football shirts fashion in the us now 😭

Jk, wear what you want, maybe try going for some vintage ones next. The new ones remind me of the state of the club"
These long term reviews are more interesting actually. Would be great to see about other gadgets too.
"I got the 15pro max on release and it is the best phone i ever had. Never had any overheating issues, and I only now realized how annoying the sharp edges were on the previous models. Camera is amazing, screen is great, it looks awesome, I am so happy with it. I wish the battery was slightly larger but for the average user it will be fine. 

I highly recommend it honestly"
What’s that weather app ?
MKBHD to Barcelona HERE WE GO!!!!!!
got the iphone 13 but even though it doesn't sound smart. im planning to use the pro max to last me a few years so we'll see how that goes. I was a bit hesitant from your comments from last video but i appreciate you making another video.i clearly see your point on each video and you continue to be the voice of decisions we make when it comes to technology
which weather app is that?
Happy birthday Marques 🎂
You are The best
I wonder how much apple pays you🤨
Where is the autofocus video of your 911
The titanium frame makes the iPhone look like a toy. It also feels like one when in hand.
How do you survive without a kickstand??
Please make review of 15  review after 3 months
10:10 best thing you said
"Am I the only one wondering what you have in Shortcuts? As someone that literally works in IT automation, I would be very curious what Shortcuts you have setup to make your life easier 😁"
Rewatching the video because of the thing you said at the last 🤯 just wow..!
Now i'm waiting for that Porche 911 video
FCB ⚽️ 👏
L varca
The Barcelona Jersey surprised me 🤣
Congrats on the 911
"Nice kit, Visca Barça"
"I always said the iPhone and Porsche were the same lol. I love cars and Porsche is in my future when I grow outta (I’m 50) my boy racer days. R8, Supra,  and TT RS  and then Porsche.  Congrats on your 30th"
3:50 don't use chatgpt for math
"My transition was from iPhone 8 Plus to 15 pro and indeed that was most probably the best time to change. 
About the new button I switch back to silence mode 😮 and for ChatGPT I create a shortcut for Siri. Like this I can speak with ChatGPT in my car. No Porsche but Audi Q3 Sportback. 
Indeed thanks Europe for the USB type C. 
Thanks for this review always very good. 
Peace"
iPhone ka 14
"I just transferred from android to iphone and I love the 15 pro max. Although it isn't perfect, ( the camera lags and doesn't take photos, apps crashing etc., ) I still think I got a pretty good deal ❤"
Last part 🎉
Does that Magic Trackpad ( 5:52 ) have a built in Super Drive?!
"in no way remotely is ok google a better smart assistant than siri, wack ! ask ok google to play your liked music on spotify ! I dare you !"
"I notice you are wearing Barcelona football team, is that mean you support the team? or you have a hidden message?"
Wow everything was shot on iPhone 15pro😮 noice👍🏼👍🏼
"You can ""hear"" that is was recorded on a iPhone"
"This iPhone seems to me much like the iPhone 6 and even 6S: they were stuck in a transition period before the huge jump to the iPhone 7. This is the first time I skip two phone generations in a row, but will definitely be getting an iPhone 16"
Awesome man! Happy birthday and congrats on the 911 turbo! 👊
MKBHD is a Messi fan. Niceee
Barca
"That Barcelona kit hit me where it hurts, I am a Madrid fan, as a long fan of your channel you owe me (and millions) a video with a Madrid jersey. JK love your vids buddy"
What is the name of that weather app?
"You can't download torrent
You can't upload custom gifs as comments
It doesn't have miracast
No support for emulators
No fast charging
No aod
The image sensor gets damaged and gives pink spots if you take pictures in Hard sunlight 
Still 60hz screen
Bad support for older Bluetooth devices like older cars in my case and so on
Gigantic notch"
The Barca shirt tho
"Marques: Thank you Europe…
E.U.: You’re welcome!
Apple: 💀"
pretty sure barca paid him to wear that jersey because why would you embarrass yourself so hard
My wife (Spanish) would love you for the jersey. Her favorite club. ;-)
Barcelona lessss gooo
"For camera access you can wipe the lock screen from right to left instead, which is faster than pressing the quick access button.
I added the shortcut to record video for now."
Amazing looking Porsche
This entire video is shot on an iPhone??? That's unbelievable
good one.
This is the best ad the iPhone 15pro will ever get. And buy end of January 2024 it will be the top selling iPhone. 😂
"""Thank you Europe"" it's EU, not a continent decision"
MKBHD is a Culer top❤✅️
How did you Get 1 mill views on 13 hours
"You already were my favourite YouTuber/ general content creator in the world, now you put on Barça jersey... I love you hahaha (I have a wife XD)"
"Sorry Marques, but HALA MADRID"
THANK YOU!! EUROPE!!!!🎉
"Dude where did you learn how to use words. So smooth, always perfect for explaining."
8:13 Flex indeed 😂
Congratulations on the Porsche Marques!
"Marques is the GOAT 🐐 
His style of videography has always been my favorite and also the explanation he does with these devices has always been the standard. Congrats on the 911 bro it's a beautiful car"
Are we not going to talk about the Barcelona jersey or am I the only one who's noticed that Marques is recently fond of it?
5:35 Lol this reminds me of switching to Type C from Micro USB.
I can finally reverse charge my AirPods Max from my 15 pro and literally never miss a beat. Best iPhone yet.
Okay I get it. But why is nobody talking about his Bercelona jersey? He is the one I expect the least from wearing that jersey.
has anyone notice any stutter and jumping text while scroling? same issue was in 14PM but more obvious
It still amazes me that smartphone cameras have become so good that you can just use them to make professional videos.
"What’s the MagSafe wireless charging stand I see you use for your iPhones in a lot of your videos (admittedly not this one)? It looks really good, I’d like to buy one if I can. Thanks!"
Amazing shots on ip 15 pro😮😮😮
That 992 911 Turbo! We need a review on that 🔥🔥🔥
Waiting for the best smartphone camera 2023 video
Nice soccer jersey. The same team that I am supporting. Hahaha
Which weather app is that ?
FCB
Why is no one talking about that he got a 911??!!
Battery life is absolute doo doo
"Just watched like your first video… You were like maybe 17 years old. It’s so funny because he talks like you and moves his hands like you, but it’s not really you, but then of course it is !"
Overheating issue no explain
"He literally just called a Porsche 911 ""boring"" lol"
Congrats!!! The 911 looks amazing
What weather app is that?
6:13 dog
"I’ll be honest, I was wondering if they got an intern to do the colour grade. It’s not bad but it did seem quite overly processed. 

One trick I use with my iPhone 13, not sure if will do the same on the 15 Pro, is that I would under expose the image. At ev 0, it would try to reign in the highlights and specular which means that the brighter values end up being flat as it tries to artificially recover highlight detail. If you underexpose it and bring in the highlights yourself, it’s not too bad."
why you dont get extend from lighitng to usb c
2hours charging battery 🔋 .lame
Why barça kit bro
"Basically the ""great new"" is stuff androids have for decades... What a pile of garbage, no chance this will motivate me to go back to crapapple."
Spot that BARÇA JERSEY.  HOLA CULER
It is a nice phone my wife traded her 13PM in for the 15P. I just traded my 14PM in for a Samsung Galaxy S23U with 1TB and also loving that. Though everything I used to use was iCloud but now switched to One Drive also on mac haha. Anyway great phones can't go wrong with either these days.
Battery ?
Does anybody have the same problem with one of the volume buttons less being less clicky?
OSHOMAJOSEPH WAS HERE
Top class video except the FCB jersey
I put black magic app for the action button since that is the first reason why i bought the 15 pro max
Wow! It`s so surprising to see you in a Barca jersey)) Visca Barca!
"after using my Huawei tab for nearly 7 years without a case, today it fell, and the glass broke but still, I could use it for another 5 years, I guess."
congrats on getting that car!
I was expecting to hear something about the battery and usage.
Loving it that he is wearing a barca jersey 🔥
Nice shirt! :)
Still happy with my 13pro
"I still can’t find the weathers app which he is using in the video……
Someone please help"
"can you please check on the ios 17.2.1 update, because i use the base iphone 15 i was getting great battery life but after that update i'm facing battery drain issues. Also my battery health percentage fell to 99% it has been only a month since i've bought this phone."
You've gotten better with your outros probably now people don't tune out at the as much since the last time you talked about this
MKBHD did like Apple : Hey did you know that this video was recorded by an iPhone 15 pro ? 😂
Barça gang where you at?
"That crop thing in photos, Samsung has it since a year or 2. FYI ;)"
bro chose the right shirt to wear 🫶🏽❤️💙
If only Apple added single double and triple tap to the action button for various actions. They will probably add it to the next phone and call it revolutionary. As usual 💀
"I have an iPhone 15 Pro. Upgraded from an iPhone 8. I HATE FACE ID. It is so terrible and doesn't work half the time. Bring back the damn fingerprint sensor Apple!

1:42 - I had no idea you could do that
2:23 - I hardly use the action button. It is nice to map it to whatever, but it needs to have more options like double click, triple click, hold, etc"
Which backpack is that ?
"Nobody: 
Everybody: Pretending not to notice the Barcelona jersey 🙄"
Much awaited
What about the battery mate?
you just turned 30?? you look young asf
Last comment about all this being filmed on an iphone 15 pro ahs me like Wooo reallly?!
Forca Barcaaaaaaa
whats the weather widget or app?!
This whole video was actually about him showing off his new 911 😅
Battery life?
Bro just casually flexed his new Porsche in an iPhone video!! Love it tho!
Now we want you to get married 🥹
"Nah, just really doesn’t seem anywhere near worth an upgrade. Stainless steel is way better and feels more premium, Dynamic Island is generally useless, side action button is pretty useless, back material more fragile. The 13 pro max is probably the PINNACLE of iPhone designs."
"I’m still kind of lukewarm about Apple, with their incredibly tiny annual updates, anti right to repair, taking ancient technology and pretending like it’s the new hotness when they finally implement it, etc, even though I’ve been an iPhone user for a few years now. I want to go back to Android, recently bought a Pixel 8 Pro and actually returned it because it was sooo badly implemented. I use a fairly new (not latest model) Samsung phone for work and often want to spike it because it works so badly. I’m hoping that someone eventually makes an Android phone that’s good enough so I can finally switch back.

That said, I don’t see any reason get a 15 if you have a 13 or 14 now. The fact that the headlining feature for this phone is that they finally switched to the same port that literally everything else has been using for at least 5 years (and Apple has been using on the MacBooks and iPads for at least a few years) kind of sums it up. I’d like to see them adopt a more usable zoom lens, like a 10x, and substantially improve the image quality of the wide angle camera. As it is, it’s basically unusable in anything but the perfect lighting conditions, and even then it is a substantial step down from the main camera.

The fact that this was all shot on a smart phone and literally nobody would have known the difference shows that all the companies that insist that they need thousands of dollars in basically cinema-quality camera equipment for a YouTube channel (including this one) are basically wasting their money. It’s not the camera that makes a good quality video, it’s the talent and the editing."
Isn't the easy way to open camera is to just swipe left from the lock screen ?
Now how does that 911 sound?🎉😂
"finally, the spatial video comes out. i’ll try it for my quest 2"
"Visca Barca, Visca Catalunya!"
Feels weird seeing Marques in a Barca jersey 😅.
Whats ur battery health?? 😂
"So yes, shot on iPhone! I have the feeling that for A Roll, you put back too much sharpening."
What’s that weather app?
Channel is dying.
It's hard to ignore that Maqrques has really big hands. The phone looks tiny.
"As someone who has also turned 30 this year, mood"
LETS GOO! THE WHOLE VID WAS SHOT ON AN IPHONE 15 PRO!!
"That is why I feel there is ""something"" on how the scenes pop out in the video.. it is because it is shot on iPhone. Well done"
"Gratz dude, you finally own a car 👌"
You wowed me when you said it was all shot on an iPhone 15. I am waiting for The Studio video to see how it was shot.
Mans is a Barca supporter? Bro can you do the A53 2023 months later?
"hi @mkbhd, as a car enthusiast, could you please compare the Turbo S vs the Plaid as daily drivers?
I know it sounds insane but I think that, apart from the look, these 2 cars can both be daily drivers and, to some extent, they can be compared."
"You are complaining about Lightning cable for airpords pro but they come with wireless charging, so use your phone to charge and you dont need lightning and you are using Type C to still charge indirectly your headphones"
What about heating issues and less cameras consistency as compared to previous models
Leaving a like here for that barca jersey ❤🔵
Whoooo Barca 🎉
Can you do pixel 8 pro
real ones recognise that wallpaper
"I got it as an upgrade after three and half years, took a black titanium pro, just one of those flawless devices for me."
Happy birthday bro !
shot on iphone 15 pro
Happy Birthday bro!!! 🎂
So do you recommend the iPhone Pro or the Pro Max? I recently switched to the smaller because I am can use it with one hand and maybe because I am almost 40 so I don't like to carry giant phones :)
iPhone video has come a long way. I couldn't believe that this video was shot on an iPhone. Amazing!
what is that weather app called? looks so cool!
can you help me
"Marques, You're a Barcelona Fan? What the hell??"
Great choice of car !!
"As a European; you‘re welcome, enjoy that USB-C port 😎
Also - as a European - delighted to see that Barcelona jersey 🙌🏻"
"Its a great phone, if the camera bump doesn’t look like the tip of a gatling gun i would definitely buy it."
Everything is okay but that Barca camiseta 🙁
"So, this year, where is the best smartphone 2023 - The Google Pixel 8 - ""3 months later""?"
"Great video Marques👌🏼
1 Completely shot on iPhone, sick!
2 Dynamic Island swipe pro tip, thanks!
3 Congrats on acquiring a 911!
Really enjoy my 15 Pro too. Such a typical evolutionary upgrade, but all little refinements combined make it great."
"That's the most subtle flex about buying a 911 I've seen so far. Congrats, to many accident-free miles!"
I love the Barcelona Jersey
"Did you really need to tell us about your birthday 911 and talk about ""living with a 911"" like it's a normal thing that ordinary people do? My god you are becoming so out of touch."
I'm voting for a car tour shot on the 15 pro 😃🔥
Updated to this from the 12 mini and have been very happy.
What was the breed of the dog ?❤
Wow 😮
😢
ya perfact money $
Amazing video! Love the production quality and it was shot on iPhone! Keep up the great content 😎
Wasn’t ready to see him all grown up with a beard.
Except for some stabilization issues I did not notice anything even colors
BTS video needed
Don't go with 15pro Max i repeat don't go with 15pro Max
"For someone who never had an Iphone and i need a new phone, do you think I should wait for the 16 gen, or get the 15 base or 15 pro? Also 128gb is enough?"
"You bought Turbo S, that is not boring 😅😊"
"People, listen: the IP 15 is a “14s” … no reviewer out there has convinced me otherwise. If some “mod shop” could replace the Lightning port of the 14 with a USB-C, this would make the 15 a “dud.”"
okok turbo s flex
Now after you said it's shot on Iphone I need to rewatch the video just to appreciate the quality a bit more 😁
Lmao income must be tight😂😂😂
"I feel MKBHD really missed the mark with the action button. You can literally have different orientations choose what the button does, which makes it vastly more customizable. For instance, I have my phone in portrait mode and push the action button, it turns on the flashlight. if I hold it in landscape and push action button, it opens the back camera. If I have it face down and push button, it sets my phone to mute. All of this done by one button one setting I just change the orientation of my phone."
wow last spoiler of this shot was taken entirely iphones was really shocking 😅
"Marques: You will be super surprised at the end of the video because the whole video is shot on iPhone 15 pro

Me: Just listened the whole video thanks to youtube premium"
What weather app is that?
That 911 is sweet welcome to that full life experience!
"Thanks for another thought provoking video. I went back after watching this to the video from 2 years ago, ""Reviewing EVERY iPhone Ever!"".
My conclusion is skip this year and get the iPhone 16 Pro. The iPhone 15 Pro needs just a little refining here and there to make it the ultimate iPhone. For example, I would like to see USB4 support."
£999 + for shit battery life    :P
Keep up the great work brotha!
"Congrats sir for your New porche, also nice video❤"
lesgo BCN!
"4:45 - NOT as fun as Motos' 'Twist Wrist' action to get to the camera, or the 'Double Karate chop' for flashlight! (Both actions while phone is off too!) 😏😉🤣🤣🤣👍
😎🇬🇧"
The moment I saw first shot... i saw like... wellll ..... shot on iPhone. Congrats on new sweet ride !!!
"I will have to hear from Samsung on the S24, before making a choice."
"can someone please tell me what the weather app is? i searched ""!weather"" on the apple store but couldn't find it"
Why is it that the Usb-C charger for my wife's iPhone 15 Pro doesn't charge my Oneplus phone? Nothing happens...
Damn the video quality🤯🤯 didn’t expect that to be shot on a smartphone. The video looked sharper than your usual videos😅
VISCA BARCA ❤️💙
The Barca jersey? 😮😮😮You've been with Barca all along??
"Kind of ish Fun fact MKBHD and I share birthdays
We both were born on December 3rd."
"As a leftie, I find the action button is in a perfect spot!"
Would lock screen widgets not be more useful than a single assignable hardware button?
whats the weather app mkbhd using on his phone? @mkbhd
Bro please give us the bts of the video
Congrats!! Happy birthday!
What's that weather app and widget? Looks pretty cool!
The Porsche looks clean
iPhone 15 are a failure series 😂😂😂
The fact that the video quality has got so good that we cant even tell anymore is outrageous.
"Who the hell would upgrade cuz of ""titanium"""
Barcelona fan ay?
It's a good phone but the battery is disappointing for a cell phone called Pro.
0:13 Forca Barca
The 15 pro was a downgrade from the 11 for me its so glitchy and laggy
"Cool, so my shitty 7 year old phone can still do all the same useful things as the latest and greatest from Apple. Good to know."
"If the cameras and I message isn’t a deal breaker for me , should I still consider upgrading to the Iphone or should I get the S24 ultra …. ?"
"7:22 so does that mean with this update iphone 12 can do the same, like it makes sense right if 😅the only reason is camera alignment😂😮"
"thank you for the review, just upgraded from my XR to a 15 pro, cant wait for another 5 years, tbh I feel like the Xr was one of the best phones they have ever made but im happy I chose a good year to upgrade, it is so freeing to only have usb-c for everything"
How come that no one in the comments has talked about how great it's that Marques is a Barcelona fan!🤩🙌
A long term review of the M1 Max MacBook Pro would be neat.
I use that screen saver .
"When you say it's shoot on iPhone, I need to rewatch it one more time. :)"
Congrats on the new turbo S 🎉🎉
Real barca fan
"Mid, typed from an iPhone, why are we hailing these mediocre capabilities I have an iPhone and am trying to switch to Samsung, the amount of problems I’ve had with this iPhone which isn’t even two years old is ridiculous ( camera not activating upon request from the lock screen or flashlight and it pissis me off especially when I’m trying to get into my locked house at night 😡 fvck iPhone simple features messing up"
"I knew it it was shot on iphone 15. It didn't felt like coming  from red.
i won.🙃"
L jersey
"10:11 and that is why I was thinking from the very begining this video, ""is there anything wrong in my flat screen?"" 😅"
My whole wedding was recorded off an iPhone 15
"Bro please suggest me best iphone for vlogs recoding , I can   Afford iphone 15 pro or 14 pro which one best for vloging & i can also afford iphone 15 pro max so please suggest me please please."
Am I the only one who misses the old action toggle? I keep pressing the action button mistakenly while trying to increase volume
Why don't Marques make 3 months later reviews for Samsung?
A very happy birthday to Marques🎉❤😊!!!
FCB ❤
Happy birthday MKBHD! Been watching you for over 10 years now. Great work brother. I love my iPhone 15 Pro Max. 😊
"Action button is bound to google translate, as someone living in a country where i am still learning the language it is great. Battery life, going from 11 pro to the 15 pro max is insane. Very happy with mine, should hopefully last me at least 4 years. And the 11 pro goes to a cousin and will work for another 4 years i am sure. And of course the USB C is great for backups and transferring photos."
"Faster way to get to the camera, just swipe the lockscreen to the left."
VISCA BARCA ❤️💙
"hehehe, no more Tesla? you pimped it for years! "
"Barça shirt! good choice! Nice video by the way, as usual. Keep it up."
"using the pro, not the pro max?"
Action button is hard to reach for right handed people…but perfect for lefties.
8:06 CAP CAP CAP 😂😂
LOL nice T-Shirt bro 🎉
It's crazy that I knew you were gonna shoot a video fully on iPhone but this still caught me off guard
"My 14 pro was heating like crazy with just 15 mins of GPS or camera use , and selfies seemed worse than old 11 . Exchanged it for regular iphone 15 base varient , now everything is very good . The pro models would be even awesome . Apple really missed the mark with iphone 14 series"
6:15 doggy.
"When you review one plus 10 T, you said that apple Company will never change the 🔇 🔕  mute botten ,it's like their  identification.😅 ,they did this now you have to pay 1000.000 dollars to someone😂 ?"
"You're a Barca fan?! I see what you did there, an easter egg perhaps?😂You should review some sport tech too."
Do an Autofocus on your 911. Please.
"Wow, how bad this video quality compared to others"
Awesome job on the 911
VISCA BARCA LETS GO MARQUES
Visca El Barça ❤️💙
Marques a Barca fan? Welcome to the team brotha
"Two Surprises at the end !! Damn ! shot on Iphone 15 pro and the Porsche in matte black !  I DID NOT SAW THAT COMING. Most of people are gonna buy Iphone due to this ""shot on Iphone"" thing as apple did in their event."
Nice shirt!
"I’ve upgraded to the 15pro. And I think until I break it or lose it, I will stick with it for a while"
Hala madrid
Love the dog in the background
the phone wallpaper brings back memories fr
If you don't want wear and tear: don't use it.
Just wanted to what's that weather app that your toggling around with?
brooo marques with that BARCELONA jersey ...FIREEEEEEEEE❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥
"You said your going to surprise us and you did, i didn't expect to hear shot on the iPhone"
where are behind the scenes? or the mic setup?
I expected that this vid was shot on an iphone 15 pro cause you were talking the same in Waveform clips about how you guys wanted to try what apple did and your video is excellent.  I'm Also hoping to see a video about how you guys did this video in a video
"Fun fact
The titanium disperse the impact making more posible to brake the screen and back more frequent because the glass would take most of the impact
So thanks apple😂😂"
Shot on iphone 15 Pro! 😯
Awesome video as always! I would like a 3 months later video for the s23 ultra! Just switched to Samsung after 10+ years on iPhone 😮
Paid by apple
"Marques, which car do you like better, the Tesla or the Porsche and why?"
Subtle flex at the end 😂
No way was that whole video shot on an iPhone.
"Irrelevant to the vid , but MKBHD is a barca fan ??? Let's goooo"
Bwahahaha! Marques turns 30 and buys a mid-life crisis car 😂 I love it.
damn great video quality from iphone
Nice jersey 😍 like your content even more now !
10:20 😅😅
Am I the only one who was distracted the the piece of glitter on Marques' forehead?
The battery is not as good as I expected
This video is so apple 😂
WOW!
"Mkbhd played the Apple Move in the last : This entire video, every single shot was shot on an iPhone 15 Pro 🤯"
8:43 does Marques already have the Apple Vision pro? 👀👀😅😅
Absolutely great video
"I have the regular Pixel 6, should I upgrade to The iPhone 15 pro or Pixel 8 Pro, any suggestions out of experience?"
Visca el Barca
Can I have your old iPhone please
I’ve been dying for that weather widget…what app is that?
Congrats on the dream ride! Please give us as much 911 content as possible! 😁
Seriously I didn't think it was shot on iphone before the last msg!
"I came to 15 pro max from the 11 pro max
I can say that iOS 17 is so buggy i thought it was my old phone but is just iOS"
Good to see you in FCB shirt!
"Ayy you finally got to make you're own ""Shot on an iPhone"" video. really cool. Didn't notice"
"Bro called the Porsche 911 boring, I felt that he called me poor in so many different ways 😭"
"I was using an iPhone SE 2022 for some time now. 
I just got the 15 pro max 512gb, It’s a HUGE Difference.
I am really happy with it"
I still using iPhone 8 plus. 🤦‍♂️
Dude just casually dropped a couple nucler bomb at the end. Got a porche 911 and the whole video shot on iphone. Honestlyi didnt realized this video was not shot on that monster Red cam
"iPhones are indeed impressive when it comes to taking videos. Wishing Marques would a shoot one the Pixel 8 pro, a long term review as well."
Forca barca
Bro which wallpaper ur using in this video on iPhone 15 pro?
I'm much more surprised that Marques wearing FC Barcelona shirt 😁
"Not gonna lie. I'm using my s20+ more often. Year after year I get a new iPhone and I just like my Samsung more and more. S20+ all the way. Light, comfortable, camera is on point with 8k24, waterfall design, microsd. It's just perfect. I might switch away from my 15pro max...."
Hala Mardid
Hugh Hou has a video how to watch spatial videos on oculus/meta quest 2/3
What wallpaper is that?
Ayyyoo Barca fans 🔥
"So you're using the new action button to open an app which is 1 cm away from the actual action button, right next to a shortcut which does the same thing, with the ability to use a voice command or a gesture to again to the same thing, has society really got in that lazy?"
He knows nothing about Redmi notes app. Especially quick notes
Love the og wallpaper
Is Barcelona jersey just a way to pay respects to Europe for forcing apple to use USB-C?
2:38 is that a make up kit 😹😹😅
I thought pixel 8 pro was your daily driver?
i dont understand. why the main and uw cameras have to be positioned horizontally for vision pro recording?
Nice
The end was hilarious 😀
iPhone | Porche 911 === Cold blooded Tech
Insane ♥️ watching this video on my iPhone 15 Pro Max Natural Titanium!
"Dear Marques, my name is Francis, i'm from Ghana if you ever do phone giveaway please remember me because been going to internet cafe to watch your videos. I feel in love with tech because of you, its make me feel updated even though i do not own any tech product. All my friends are loving you"
"Team no-screen-protector, no-case here."
"my coworker bought an 15 pro and after playing around with it i kinda regret not waiting out to get either 15 or 15 pro, instead of the basic 14"
Dont agree iphone 15 rather have iphone 14
shot on an iphone? thats crazy
This Barcelona jersey not cool for videos stick to mlbhd merch
No talk about display burn-in fiasco?
That was impressive! 😊😊
Dude he kept it clean by saying it was shot in an iPhone
"""this entire video and every single shot was shot on the iPhone 15 pro"" and on that bombshell..."
iPhone is just missing one thing that is under display fingerprint 🤔
3:12 Left handed people: 🤨🤨🤨
Action button camera gang represent
"Maan, congratulations! Waiting for full review!"
I didn't expect that American people are interested in football (soccer) 😅
The best part of the video was the dog that walked past Marques <3
weather widget name?
Dude sneaked a pixel 8 image in the review.
2:15
WHAT WAS THAT WEATHER APPPPPP
"911, good taste 👍"
"Opened youtube and just saw Marques uploaded long term review of iPhone 15 pro. This is the best way to end year!!!! Using 15 pro max myself and loving it. And way MKBHD said it’s sweet spot to upgrade, that perfectly defined 15 pro for me. Thank you for great video! That surprise at end though 😮"
The fan noise in the background is kinda annoying. Can anyone tell what is the white noise from.
FCB ❤
"Hey, happy belated birthday!"
Proper flex Marques! Happy to see you again.
Oh I thought I was way older than him.. should’ve done a bday vid going shopping for the car or something FLEX😎 I wonder what’s his sign 🤔
I'm surprised there's no Real Madrid fan boys in the comments ridiculing the Barca jersey
This shows how in video audio and color grading is almost everything
"If USB C is worth mentioning and a big feature, how come no YouTubers ever said before it is a downside?"
Happy 30's Marquez
Ironically the lock screen camera shortcuts are faster compared to the buttons
MKBarcelona
"My history with iPhone upgrades in a nutshell: iPod Touch (+ Blackberry torch), iPhone 4, iPhone 7, iPhone X, iPhone 13 Pro.  Now waiting for the iPhone 16 ☺"
What's the deal with the battery after 88 days of usage?
"The main difference between a 911 and an iPhone is that the 911 will survive for decades. About 80% of all 911s ever produced still exists today. You are now 30, but if you care well for your 911, you might still drive it at the age of 70. They basically survive until they get irreparable in a major accident. All Apple products are still meant to be thrown away after a few years. That might also be the fate of most Teslas."
Shit man!! YOU ARE A BARÇA FAN .. I’m your long time subscriber but never knew that 😮
No comment on battery life? K
Barca 😏
I literally saw no difference in the video quality! It’s amazing! 🤩
The Barcelona jersey is fire 👏🏼
Can't wait for 911 video on AutoFocus!
Where can i get that wallpaper ?
anyone have wallapaper link ?
Congrats! 911 turbo s is an amazing choice
"Ok Marques, you love showing us that weather app. What is it called, we wanna download it lol"
Sick shirt
literally my Sony Ericsson from 2015-16. had the camera button ._.
Visca el barca 💙❤️
i honestly didnt realize that most of that was actually shot on an iPhone 15 Pro
Marques a Barca fan ?
Nice Jersey 🔥
You just sold me an iPhone... Even though on my channel I mostly use the stock footage...
Bro cooked and left nothing behind.
"I noticed an unusual color profile on this video, but i thought it was color graded differently 🐸. You said in one of your podcast that you are gonna do that"
"please do a video of the iphone 12,13, and 14 in 2024"
Hey Marques! Belated Happy Birthday! And Congrats on your Porsche!! It looks amazing!
And thats the guy who shoots on Red whoaaaaa
"from my 1st iPhone that I have which is the 14, then switching to 15promax this year, I must say I didn't regret it."
"My iPhone Chronology

5 - X - 15pro max

Wife’s iPhone Chronology

4 - 7 - 13pro"
A true inspiration
As someone who works on cars a lot I have my action button set to the flash light and I use it many many times a day
Is the dog at 6:14 wearing headphones or am I tripping?
Is Monarch logo is inspired by your's?
Not a fan of the 15
"after all that, in no way is this significantly better than my A54 lol"
That ending statement was badass.. got an 15 pro and loving every bit of it and what u said is actually true..
"10:09 😜🤪😛😋😍🥰😍 You, the MAN!"
It's hilarious when you showed the live screen of your phone the signal bar was always in bad reception. Da** when is Apple going to fix this?
"10:13 Do you have any tips to avoid lens flare? Most of my videos and photos from iPhone 15 Pro have flares, so shooting around lights is very difficult."
"10:13 Do you have any tips to avoid lens flare? Most of my videos and photos from iPhone 15 Pro have flares, so shooting around lights is very difficult."
Very nice shirt Marques - visca el Barça 😊
Liked the Jersey 🐐
Idk why but this video was so perfect!!!❤
Happy birthday man 🎉
❤
forca barca
6:28 what is this weather app ?
"Anyone knows if this was shot on 24, 30, or 60fps?"
Using the action button for the camera is the lamest thing to do with it
WHAT'S THAT WEATHER APP THAT YOU USE? I have the same 15 Pro but without that weather app. Where can I get that? Thank you!
Nothing about the battery? Or comparing it to the 14Pro and how insanely quick it lost battery health? Yk what 90% of the buyers would want to know. I guess Apple pays well to say only what they need you to say.
ZTE Nubia Z60 Ultra review when?
lol zooming in on that pixel 8 and cropping it was prolly an easter egg haha
The last part … shot on iPhone didn’t expect that 😮
no battery n heat update ?
I left my 15 pm in the box.  Got it charged at 55% and still using my 14 pro 😂
"Hey! Is the setting your recorded this video with is the same you showed in the part, where you explained vision pro capture thingy?"
Wallpaper?
Hit like if you are watching this on iPhone 15 pro
Porsche 911 Turbo S
"The Weather app is called ""(Not Boring) Weather"""
"Congrats on the 911 man, that’s one of my dream cars. If I’ve got one of those by my 30th birthday, I’ll know I did something right."
What’s that weather app?
What's that sick weather app 9:10
Marques is a Cule 💙❤️
Woah
"Hey, happy birthday Marques🎉"
Congrats on that Turbo 911
That twist at the end 😂 It really delivers.
"3 months is a long time??
Wtf"
Congrats on the 911
Clean video apart from that barcelona jersey 😂😂
I mean Happy 911 Birthday!!  I'm jealous as all get out!!
Barcelona lets gooooooo🎉
As a power-pdf-markup-user i find this video very misleading... Not happy with the channel.
"Nice one MKBHD, now do an s23 ultra long term review. 😁👍🏾"
"dont you regret buying crazy expensive camera gear, once you know, that videos 99% of the goodness can be shot on your phone"
sweet
“shot on iPhone”🔥
Ehhh your a blau grana ❤️💙
I love your Jersey ! The best team in the world ! Visca el Barca !
Now way it was short on an iPhone it looks sooo dame real
no way bro's a barca fan
"We want the same with s23 regular 
Please do it"
"i even watched the studio video where yall discused  the ""lets shoot a video on an iphone and not tell em""
and i still didnt expect it"
Congrats on the Porsche 911
that Barca jersey is sick
"Hi @mkbhd Hope you are well today. It seems like you are running out of content. Also, it's good to see you growing with team and responsibilities. Happy new year, hope you find new content, and ideas."
i just got the iphone 15 pro and my battery is worse than my brothers... they gave the 13
Why did you choose 15 pro instead of 15 pro max?
10:08 got me there 😮😮😮
What weather app was that? Thanks
Fútbol club Barcelona
U mean smartphone cameras are starting to replace professional cameras
Did he say a 911 isn’t flashy 😅
Apple have onboarded legacy devices by providing them updates and security patches on other hand people keep waiting for updates to rollout. Though the apple devices are little expensive it's worth to buy .
Is marques a barca fan?🥳🥳
4500+ comments and only about 4 of them are about that Barca shirt? Disappointing.
Whats the weather app called? anyone?
"3:46 chatGPT is soo bad at math and physics, it isn't even close on solving 'good' high school problems, i have tried a lot, it does not work"
"Video about iPhone 15 Pro shot on an iPhone 15 Pro, that was a nice touch."
So happy for you getting a 911!
Forca Barca
Nice flex at the end
Hey mk wats tht weather app u are showcasing on ur videos in iPhone anyone who has any hint please reply
Ayee barca ❤
You can't just pull an apple on us bro!
FCBarcelona jersey to thank Europe for USB-C?
Dang...dude only 30 and owns a 911. And here I'm 35 with $60k of student loan debt.💸💸
The DRIP 💧
Porsche is always the answer
I’m selling all my other cameras and just going to use my iPhone now. This is insane.
What app is that @6:26
3:25 ABSOLUTE SAVAGE
Great shirt by the way. FC Barcelona for life🙌🏿. iPhone 15 is truly unique piece of hardware with tons of on capabilities.
FC BARCELONA 💙❤️💙❤️
Thumbs down just for the shirt. C'mon man! 👿
"After I realized it was shot on the 15 Pro, it took in the video again.😂"
ahhh finally that shotoniPhone promise getting fulfilled from the Studio channel.....thanks for the detailed review
link to the wallpaper??
I triple tap the back of my iPhone 13 Pro Max to open the camera.  Sorta cool feature.
"Give us the 911 Video ⚡9:55
🚀"
I think the iphone 15 is better value for money
Would love to see one of these vids for the s23 ultra. Please?
FCB!
"Finally the surprise ""Shot on iPhone"" video came! I did not even think about it being shot on a mobile phone, however, i did notice that there was much more background noise than usual in the video, even before knowing it was shot on iPhone. Did you guys shout with the stock microphone on the iPhone?"
I love your videos mkhbd! I just bought pro max thank you
didnt knew he was barca fan (+ points)
FC Barcelona 👌✌️❤
visca el barca!! 💙❤️
Umtiti doing phone review now?
Looking fabulous with beard!
Watching this only to validate my horrible 15 Pro purchase decision.
THE BARCELONA JERSEY! AVE CULER
i won’t upgrade until they put the fingerprint reader under the screen
getting a 1TB Black Titanium iPhone 15 Pro Max next weekend…trading in a 256GB iPhone 14 Pro Max…
Do a pixel video
You given same shock as apple did at the end of the video!
Is this the pro or the pro max?
Congratulations on the Porsche. You're in the Big Leagues 👏🏾
"I knew there was something different about this video, even guessed it was a different camera! I feel very proud of myself 😂 It was really good"
"Went from 3GS > 4S > X > 15PM
Can’t see much reason to upgrade again until Apple does a foldable."
we have to keep horizontal because we have eyes next to each other not on top of each other...this sentence is humorous😆😆😄
Barcelona? Nike? Spotify?
I was yawning when he said Porsche 911 and just heard “bush did 911”
where is your cyber truck
"I knew this video felt different, but not that much worse, so I'm not surprised about this being shot on a 15 Pro. Cool to see your 911 but definitely prefer a GT3 over a Turbo."
"The iPhone 15 Pro Max is the best built iPhone since the iPhone 13 Pro Max. The hand feel of the brushed titanium is great and you often would want to put it down from your hands. I love the curves around the phone, love the speakers, confident to take quick photos and videos, love the ecosystem and last but not least absolutely getting the most out of my 15PM with its battery performance, zero concerns. If you're into large phones, this is the one to go. If you don't want a big phone, you can try it or else 15 Pro is a good choice."
911 its crazy
"Hey Marques, i really liked the video but from a channel like yours I do think the quality could be better"
MARQUES GOT A 911 WHAT I AM OVER THE MOON HELLO???????
"Review on Porsche 911, please 🙏"
What a beautiful shirt. FC Barcelona ❤

🤢🤢🤢🤢 barcelona jersey!!!🤢
The way he shows the device from up in the staircase like an idiot is mildly infuriating. 🙂
Congratulations Man for Your New Car.....
no one talk about the signal hah
@mkbhd an Arsenal shirts suits you much better😊
What about heating of iphone 15 this year!??? My iphone still heats in smallest tasks. 😢
Great video besides - I haven’t seen that Justin Maller Wallpaper in a while 🔥
almost 15 years been silently watching you sir and you have been a spectacular  all the way !! Nice work Marques
"For those wondering what weather app that is, cuz I did too. Its called ""(Not Boring) Weather"""
the reveal at the end blew me away. this is close to $10000 camera shots. wow!
Barcelona jersey 🤮🤮🤢
Congrats on the 911- such a cool car. The 15 pro quality is insane
what is the weather app that marques keeps showing in the videos? i mean the one in the widget.
I use a case but have yet to put a screen protector on cause the scratch resistance has seemingly been noticeably better for me.
Shot on the iphone he gave us that apple event. 🤝🏾 people will try to say samsung better camera but no i really think not even photos when u really know how to use it remember iphone using 48 mp the other like 200 mp and iphone still looks that great like the other phones sam with ram they dont need that much cuz they know how to optimize it!! To me thats more impresiv but something great will be always hated by #2 remember that ☝🏾
Barcelona? Did they  pay you to wear that?
nothing and I mean NOTHING IS BETTER THAN A NAKED PHONE... its HOW IT WAS MEANT TO BE ... I rock a MagSafe pop socket and thats it
I upgraded from the 14 pro to 15 pro max. I miss the 14 pro sometimes but overall can’t go back without thinking it’s a downgrade. The camera is insanely good and yes insanely better. USB c on apple is way more useful too.
My 15 pro max homescreen stuttering
Great Review. Hope to see the same for Google pixel 8 pro
"Dude, that is hilarious. I thought you shot with your red camera😢"
Bruh the 992.2 is insane! Keep up the good work and all the helpful tech information! 🔥🔥🔥
Cool always ❤
“This whole video was shot on a Porsche 911”
This is such a great video!
"Just got my new iPhone 15 pro max, and I’ve been loving it. Switched from iPhone 12 and always feels surreal having this phone. Battery is a tank, camera is super crisp along with video and it’s so smooth and no issues so far. 100% recommend if you have the budget."
Guys there's spoiler in comment plz don't read further!
Can someone please tell me what weather app he uses??????
I’m not surprised that this was shot on iPhone. He shoots almost all of his auto focus videos with the phones he tests.
As an alien whose eyes are on top of each other...I do not find this spatial video feature to be useful at all.......
For ur next video u should wear a club America jersey after club America beating Barcelona
Its about time that i update my phone. Been using Xsmax since 2019 when i didn't like the introduction of 11pro camera. Changed my battery this year when the original battery hit 80%. Also fact that iOS is the last support on my iPhone. The new one that i will get will serve for few years as well. @mkbhd thanks for this video eye opener
"The iPhone 15 Pro is the first Apple-Product I bought for myself. Am I happy? Yeah, but it's not my first iPhone, as I have been using the regular 12 for quite some time, as that's the one I got from my company. But now I wanted to have my own phone again, so when Apple announced they would finally not be the stup...born kid anymore and switch to USB-C, I was all in on the game. With that said, it was not always clear to me that I wanted an Apple phone, it still is not to be honest. After getting it, I was also met with the question and now what... I needed a new private laptop... Should I go all in and check for a MacBook Pro for myself (got an Intel one from the company as well)... And the answer was: Hell no... Overpaying twice to trice for glorified phone hardware in another formfactor is a little too much for me. So, now I have a phone which works best within it's Apple eco-system, but I don't have that one available. Even my friends or family usually don't use Apple... Still, no regrets and will keep the Phone for 3-4 years at least, if possible. The videos it takes are great, the possibility to transfer them to my portable SSD directly, is great... And the biggest reason I went with Apple this year... It's small, I like the formfactor of the 15 Pro... It fits in my front-pocket, no complaints! Sounds like a stupid reason? Maybe, for me it was the dealbreaker with the S23 Ultra."
"i was 100% expecting the video to end with ""this was shot on iphone"" and here we go"
that porsche tho 🥶
lol.. mother effer.. a Porsche IS flash and dramatic..  WTF?
Markass Brownpee is a Capricorn!!! of course he is! the GOAT now it all makes sense
"I upgraded to a 15pm from a 13pm, the 13 felt way more luxurious, but the 15 feels more durable."
I bought the iPhone 15 Pro yesterday and will be switching from 11 Pro. Currently waiting for everything to be backed up on the iCloud. Can’t wait to use it.
Bro casually dropping bombs at the end
My 14 Pro Max does the same thing?
which weather application is that ?
"Who cares about the phone, let’s see more of that car! 😍"
Good stuff. Now we need one for Pixel 8 Pro please.
Marques jst drop the bomb at the end by mentioning shot on 15 pro
Battery?
"Very nice, congratulations on the 911."
You a barca fan marques? Love the jersey! Visca barca y Visca catalunya!
Barcelona shirt I'm off
Daamn congratulations 🎉🎉 for that 911
"I have a Samsung note 10+ and it’s time to upgade. This iPhone 15 pro max is on my radar. Had iPhone 4 before and have iPads now but no other Apple stuff. What phone do you recommend in my situation? Maybe a folding phone. (Not flip) screen size, camera quality and about 4 year lifetime are what I value."
I haven’t upgraded since the iPhone 11 Pro Max. Been thinking of upgrading and this video helped me make that decision. Thank you

"BRRROOO AT THE BEGINNING I WAS LIKE WHY U SO CLOSE TO THE CAMERA ,,,,,NOW WE KNOW."
FORCA BARCA
Gay phone
Marques iSheep
"Wow, he's finally using the 6.1"" variant iPhone AND bought a Porsche? He is clearly growing nicely into his 30's."
Happy belated.. perfect spec on the 911.. amazing review as always 👌🏿
"Yessssss shot on iphone!😂😂😂😍😍😍 keep it up !) 

[congrats on a car! Love it!]"
I just upgraded from an iPhone XR to the 15 Pro Max. Very big upgrade and very much worth it imo.
"That translate mod to action button is actually useful when you are travelling on countries that most people do not know how to speak english like Japan, Vietnam etc."
HAPPIE 30th BIRTHDAY... FROM INDIA(CHENNAI)
Visa el Barca
Really Marques? Barcelona jersey??
"I've been satisfied with a thicker and more durable hydrogel film that I had installed in a shop. It prevents those scratches. I don't drop my phone and I keep it in a case, but these modern screens are just really, really prone to getting annoying scratches. The cheaper and thinner hydrogel screen protectors that I installed before were all crap."
When is the blind smartphone camera test video coming?
"Hey Marques, can we know if any additional lenses were used with the iphone for this video? 
If so, which ones?"
This was hilarious 😅
"I upgraded from a regular iphone 11 to an iphone 15 pro max, and I love it! Such a big jump in quality and features, and I am confident that it will last me at least as long as my 11 did (if not longer since I got the pro version). It's a great phone!"
"Awesome review @mkbhd
Pretty happy with the 15 pro, only complaint is the battery life. Wish they had fit a bigger battery"
that video quality is very good. I couldn't tell it was an iPhone video.
Are you a fan of FC Barcelona ?
Happy 30th 🎉
"So far I’ve had a pretty decent experience with my 15 Pro. 
- Battery Life is pretty mid it’s good to know that I don’t always need a charger 24/7 though however I expected a bit better
- The Screen is brilliant
- The Camera is top tier
- USB-C is of course great (but not a huge deal since I was android before).
- The power is incredible as well!"
Dyum .... You should do a tutorial on how to take professional videos on iPhone 15 pro max
@mkbhd What is the best 3rd party charger for iPhone 15 Pro...?
Still on my 11!
does spatial vedio supports for vesion pro 15plus?
I’m waiting for Tim Cook to quit throwing his pro-censorship hissy fit before I give Apple any more money.
VISCA EL BARÇA
I have the 15 pro max and it’s honestly really good for what I need to do
Happy birthday bro !  God bless love ur car and content
Visca Barca Visca Catalunya ❤
As long as I saw the low signal strength bar I knew it was a legitimate iPhone 😂
Did you record it in ProRes?
"Man, when you said the whole video was shot on iphone i was blown away, I did not see that coming!"
30 Years old 🥳🥳🥳🥳🤯🤯🤯🤯😵‍💫
Beast.
Bro she is sweeeeet !! 😍 Matt black.. uff
Man has a Matt black Porsche 911. 👀
"Congrats on the 911, dream car for me. I just switched from a Pixel 6 Pro to an iPhone 15 Pro Max. Bout time they switched to USB-C"
Congratulations 🎉
"""this was shot on the 15 Pro"" made me watch the video on REPEAT MODE.."
"This is pretty cool. 
Happy birthday Marques ♥
Congrats on your new 911 🍾"
"Damn, Marques really said ""Yeah that Apple vision pro trial is indeed a flex"" only to reveal his new Porsche 2 minutes later lol"
Love the fact that he is rocking a Barcelona kit
There's something Apple did with software processing for photos. Pics with 15 Pro max come out much better than 14 Pro max. 5x is one I've been using most out of new features. Weight distribution is better than 14 Pro max.
The ending was really surprising! Never noticed a bit throughout the whole video. Just amazed!!
"I upgraded to the 15 Pro from an 8 Plus. Definitely agree, good model for infrequent upgraders. I work in the film industry in camera department, and honestly I use my iPhone with an SSD now in 75% of scenarios where previously I would be reaching for my DSLR. It has me seriously considering “straddling” my camera setups, ditching the DSLR for the iPhone and a proper cinema camera for when I really want to do professional level work."
the action button is great to capture photos on horizontal
I have no clue why they would not just put a finger scanner like I have on my Fold 3. Double tap lauches Camera or whatever I want.
upgraded to the 15pro blue titanium from my iphone SE2. its a huge upgrade and i love it.
"I just changed from an iPhone 14 Pro Max to an iPhone 15 Pro and am loving the smaller size and lighter weight. I wouldn’t normally change so soon but I’m glad I did. Not for spec differences - which are only incremental - but because it’s a much more comfortable device to use and hold, and that adds up when you’re using or holding it several hours a day."
Where to get that 3D Black and White weather widget
Definitely a lifestyle upgrade
End was CRAZY. My goat tech youtube fr
I could do my Samsung M21 45 months review!
I need that lock screen wallpaper
"the lock screen shortcut for camera always felt slow and inconsistent for me, but swiping left on the lock screen also opens the camera instantly, been my go-to. Using action button would be convenient to instantly open for anywhere you might be in the phone though."
The fact that this whole video was shot on the Iphone proves that it's the best for video. No android phone could get even close.
Great video. Apple!
Happy birthday and well done on the 911 Turbo
New whip is fireee
"Hey Marques, First of all HUGEEEE FAN. Hope to meet you personally some day. 🤞 
And secondly, do a long term review for Z Fold 5 too, actual review showing performance and most importantly battery life cause i am not getting much as it's being shown in all other reviews and trust me when i say this i have watched almost every review there is to watch on YouTube. Provided i was ios user for 8 years and this year I shifted to Android. So yeah your review will make a huge difference. Literally."
I really like the long term reviews. I am really looking forward to your M1 Max review ha ha
Impressive work Marques. I would love to know how much “more work” had to be done in post if much at all vs the other videos shot on your professional equipment. This video was incredibly professional looking for the average viewer.
The Barcelona shirt tho
Thank god you choose the porsche.. i want to see a full video on that from you.. really a cool gift on 30th Bday
Rare Marquees shirt L.
What a W🔥 Jersey
Bro just casually flexed a 911 damn in an iPhone 15 review 😂❤
I will never use the action button to launch the camera on lock screen as my muscle memory is good with the current iOS setup.
30 Wow you are so young
This video was just like that last apple event that at the very end we were shocked that it was all shot on iPhone …😮😲
Super flexed on this video!  Are you going to be doing an auto episode on your 911?
Yooooo you got the 911
"man i did not expect that it would be shot on the 15 pro but i could tell it was some phone because the bokeh was wierd compared to your normal vidoes.
Great job guys, loved the review"
Wow nice! New 911 too!
"i'm not watching his videos anymore, he's a fc barcelona fan 😠😤"
Congratulations on the 911❤🎉
Could you do a video on various wireless chargers and phones having different charging speeds
What did I just watch? A few software updates and a button. “It’s worth the upgrade”. What does Apple have on you? Haha
Huge flex with the whole video being shot on the phone 0_0
Cheeky 30 yr old
CAN WE TALK ABOUT THE 911??
Review of Porche 911??? 😅
Happy belated birthday
"i switched to the 15 pro from a XR , best upgrade for sure! my Xr had a broken charge port, broken screen and severely worn out battery."
Didn't expect to hear you got a Porsche 911 congrats Marques!
Happy to say I realised in the 1st couple of seconds that Marques is not using his regular camera for shooting but with a lower end camera. Couldn't guess it was an iPhone tho.
That Barca jersey thoughhhh ❤‍🔥
why no one's talking about why there's no option to only change the alarm volume.
Gotta say your videos have been the best for making my decision to finally upgrade from my wife’s and my plain iPhone X’s to the 15 Pro for Christmas. What a leap! I’m so glad that 17.2 and then 17.2.1 were released becasue the battery life and heating issues were definitely there with the iOS loaded when we got them. They have been running great since upgrading. Still getting a handle on the camera features. As a 58 year old who’s vision is going down the drain the action button has been relegated to the flashlight. It’s just convenient. Thanks for your great content!👍
Still waiting on the re visit of the iPhone 15 Pro Max though 💯💪🏽🔋👍🏼 huge difference between a regular 15 Pro and a 15 Pro Max for a first time this year 💯👍🏼🔋💪🏽🙏🏽
Visca Barca ❤
My mans just tried to sneak an iPhone cinematic video as RED cam footage.
Marques is also a barca fan ♥️
Too much exposition
"take that barca shirt off now, lmao!"
I know Garuda Linux has a great aesthetic but why did you put their wallpaper on an iPhone
Good to see that no one really knows regarding which custom action they want to set on their Action Button.
Its rain outside?
"I was wondering why the video quality looked so crappy. It ain't no Red, boss."
Americans support Barcelona?
"I hope the ""3 Months Later"" becomes a thing in your channel for all your reviewed smartphones."
The swipe on the Dynamic Island hit me hardddd
I was casually watching this video and thinking to myself it would be a cool one if someone just casually walked in the back ground and they did and added a dog as a bonus 😂😂😅❤
"Barca fan, oouch😂"
Congratulations on the 911
"not a useful review for me, all he try to show on every phone review is one hand."
You made me purchase one
What would you  pick for low vison the the 15 pro or the pro max
Brilliant video. Absolutely brilliant!
Flexing the Porsche at the end🥶
happy birthday!!!
"I was literally saying to myself when the video started ""wow this video looks really nice"" and it was shot on an iPhone. its crazy how good its gotten"
The best use of the action button is to Pre-condition your Tesla. Pre heat’s battery for optimal performance and heats or cools cabin.
huhhh shocked i ain't notice at the video quality at all💀
"2 Mins into the video - I knew it was shot on iPhone just from the fact the video was too sharp. 
I've also been using the 15 Pro since launch and the heating issue has only been recently seems to have been fixed for my iPhone. Hope it stays that way."
I would love to see a behind the scenes of the shooting of this video!
So is the interior of the Turbo black and red? :D
"Ohhhhhhhh that end !!!
You deserve it.

Your content is sooo nice, and so well done.

You deserve it a lot.

Really hope you you enjoy !''"
Me watching this on iPhone 13 Pro Max ☺️
"If only they could nail battery life one day like Samsung has since the S21 Ultra, currently using an S23 Ultra since launch and still get well over a full day of battery with more than average usage! but you could always get the Zero Lemon 10K battery case sure it makes your phone weigh 10 pounds and become a weapon but hey it fixes apple's battery issue they seem to be unable to fix compared to groups like Samsung and Google with their phones."
"I mean, the shaperning was noticeable"
Great to hear that the phone is a good upgrade and iPhones shoot amazing videos. I still shoot on a 12 pro max and I have no complaints on the shot quality.
"Maybe Apple will make the next generation baseline iPhone come back from the iPhone 12 aligned cameras design, just for recording spatial audio…"
Whaattttt! Shot on iPhone? Now I have to watch the video again 😅
So Apple AirPods Max coming next month 😅 terrible liar 😂
"Marques Brownlee never seems to disappoint and ends a video with not just one but two curtain-droppers. Firstly, revealing his new Porsche 911 and secondly, impressing us even further that all of the footage was shot using the iPhone 15 Pro Max! Absolutely brilliant.👌👏"
This guy never fails to disappoint us 🎉❤
woahhh he dropped my jaw at the last dammmmmmmmmmmm
Food for thought: I find the best Shortcut for the pro is setting it to pre-condition your Tesla or other car. One press as you're on the way to the car to get it nice and ready for you in the winter.
Longer reviews for some of the major devices that made it to the top 5 would always be nice
I just bought the 15 pro max last week and the issue i am having is uploading pics to IG and it changing the wa they look. They look blown out.  Any idea how that can be fixed?
"Surprised to hear that this whole video was shot on an iPhone, maybe its to to change primary cameras lol…"
I am watching it on an iPhone 15 Pro Max Natural Titanium. The review was so good and I really didn’t expect the “shot on iPhone” part at the end. I really agree with whatever you said. They could’ve given us the thunderbolt but usb3.2 is also ok.
The last statement though! Amazing! Great job as always
"@mkbhd did you notice any camera issues within 3rd party apps? I have noticed that camera focus on closeup objects has been blurry. Seems to only be a 15pro issue.

Tried to toggle the macro control on and off but still an issue"
"Congratulations on your new Porsche 911, and happy 30th birthday! Revisiting phones is crucial to assess its longevity and software support."
I think you can stop spending money on cameras cause I could didn’t even notice ANY difference from your previous videos. And I’m a photographer 20 years in
"Barca Jersey?!! No marques no, this is so not right!!!"
Every single shot was shot on the iPhone 15 Pro!
i have a 14 pro and also refuse to put on a case or screen protector but my screen is so scratched the face id doesn't work if its bright and my front camera is blurry lmao. time for the 15 ig
Hey happy BD man! :)
☮️
"4:52 when the hand moves into the shot and colors shift around (don’t know how to explain, not a camera guy really) - that’s when I realised it was phone footage. Other than that I would have not noticed probably."
Meanwhile me watching it on S20 with no plan to buy apple
Iphone 15 Pro sales will go skyrocketing 🎉
⚽️
I still have the iPhone 10 Max.  It's time to update
"Regarding the look of the titanium- the biggest difference isn’t the material but the finish. I agree that the 15 Pro looks better than the 14 Pro but in my opinion this is because the brushed finish looks better than the polished finish. That said, titanium is pretty cool and it helps with marketing haha."
Best shirt ever❤❤
I've knew it was shot with a phone since 2:20
Bro wearing barca jersey
6:05 is he hinting that he already has Airpod Max with USB-C?  Just saying
I wish for that iphone 15 to replace this good ol se 1st gen on me
"Love his succinct presentation since I just ordered one and am waiting for it to be delivered.......Love his comparison to a Porsche 911.....Great that he wasn't ""drowned  out"" by annoying music like so many videos seem to like to use....I usually don't need to be entertained....just want the straight facts!!!!🥰😜"
"as a wedding photographer, action button is mapped to selfie mode, to let my couples check how they look!"
"Thank you, for the Trick for the Dynamic Island, i didn‘t know that but it will help me in daily use now."
Not gonna mention how many ppl are having problems with this one? I finally switched to iphone and my speaker already sounds blown out... It's only been 2 months or so...
Seems that iphone sales are decreasing)Marques enters the stage)
Is MKBHD a FC Barcelona fan?
911 flex at the end 🔥
it's so surprising  that this year MKBHD went with the standard pro and not the pro max. As of the tech youtuber are using the max it's nice to have a fresh perspective about the standard pro.
I think mkbhd show some world sign. I dont sure i feel like some word means something happen in the world right know.
"I was wondering why are the highlights blown?
Mkbhd be like : shot on iphone😂"
Love u MB
Very professional as always!
The car at the end ooff
🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤
What is that weather widget…Looks so good
Marques is a Culer 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Using iphone 11. Thinking to get 15 pro. Good choice ?
Happy 30th birthday! 🎉
@mkbhd you look in shape ! Nice beard ! And still aware about what iPhone it is today ! 🔥🔥
"Did you shoot this on iphone?
Ohhh fk yes you did"
love the jersey🔴🔵
"I'm planning to buy a iPhone 15 pro, if I get YouTube miney😂"
"noooooo waaayyyy, the camera is sooo gooood"
"I’ve never had issues with scratches on my screen, but there are quite a few popping up on my case less 15 PM. No drops or anything. But about 5 deep gashes on my screen that annoy the crap out of me."
It’s more than a club ❤
"you didn't mention about the battery life marques, how is the phone holding up?"
I was in doubt about video quality so I checked video resolution 😂
"Actually, someone had a good idea to create the action button to link to many apps that you regularly access very often. Save a lot of time to search through endless of home pages for it"
太酷了！没想到全程都是用15 Pro拍摄的，有机会出一期拍摄花絮吗？
Well played sir
"I have the action button set to shazam, and it works for background apps as well, like music on instagram/youtube shorts"
Hey... he's a barca fan....
Never thought I'd see Marques with a Barca shirt 😅
what’s the name of that weather app at 6:26
Content kshamam?
happy birthday broo
Lmao this might have been the most baller shit I have ever seen
"Well my 15 pro max has been a nightmare, the forst phone had dead pixels on the left border so i asked for a new phone, i traveled to colombia and requested that new 15 pro max through the retailer whcoh really sucks , it is nowhere near to an apple store.

The new 15 pm took 1 month to arrive and it had another hardware problem, the mobile anthena did not work, signal dropped and 4g wpuld not work, up to this date i have used the 15 pm a maximum of 10-15 days.

This week or tomorrow i am contacting apple for a refund."
WHY WOULD YOU USE IT WITHOUT A CASE AAAAAAHHHHHH
"If MKBHD had a real job, his 15 would be scratched beyond oblivion."
Does it heat up?
Now do the same for S23 Ultra 11 months later and shoot that video on S23 Ultra as well.
Anyone else realize Marques is growing it out?
"Makes sense that this was shot on  the iPhone. There was a weird white noise going on in the background, if you listen on headphones."
classic FCB shirt
"I feel like the video idea started from wanting to say ""This whole video was shot on an iPhone"" 😂"
"what ? its shot on iphone, i didn't notice any diff with your other videos, thats impressive"
Wait… AirPod max? In a world w @Bose and @Sony noise canceling 🤔
Two surprises in the End!
The fact that you are wearing a Barca shirt is a big win for me.
"Ooooookay we’ll be needing an Auto Focus on the Turbo ASAP, thanks."
Watching on my Moto G52 😅
Action button placement is perfect as a lefty.
MKBHD - “Thankyou Apple for giving me extra dollars for the special video ”
I love there shirt!! Force Barca!!!
Man you dropped a couple of bombs in the end 🤯
"I just want to appreciate the dedication to capitalize the ""P"" in the ""Pro tip"" inside the subtitle 🫡"
Bro is still rocking that wallpaper 🔥
I don’t think a lot of people would like you wearing this shirt.
Why does that 15 pro look like iphone 15 mini on your hands
just like the apple event. nice.
W jersey
Happy birthday Marques! Great review and I loved the Barcelona shirt too 🎉
"Help me out guys. I’m using the 11 Pro and am generally happy with it. But off late, after the updates, I can feel my phone slowing down. I know Marques advocates for a change this year, but I’m wondering if we’re likely to see a big jump for the 16 range or no. 

I don’t have 5g which is a bummer and my camera quality is now ancient in comparison. So what to do - this year or next? Seeing as we’re already half way there to 16. Thanks!"
"IMo you should just use a screen protector and case, me personally I will not use my phone without one heck when I got my pixel 6a I didn't use it for a day since I could only get those after that time period. I am so clumsy that even having a case and a screen protector doesn't guarantee that my phone will be safe, my previous phone's home button stopped working after I dropped it"
9:08 …is it a wallpaper? How to get it?
"Please put on a screen protector, Marques. It doesn't have to be this way."
VISCA EL BARCA
"I have been using iPhone 15 Pro Max since day one (I upgraded from my iPhone 6s Plus), and, honestly, it is the best upgrade I have ever experienced.

The most important factor for me to upgrade is USB-C. It is a game changer.

Though, I still miss a headphone jack. Otherwise, it is a perfect upgrade for me."
What is the weather 🌦️ app
"Brother is only 30???
I wonder how wise he will be when turning 300...i.e 270 years later"
I’ve found mine to be just..a fuckin iPhone bro. Nothing stands out about this phone lol
I'll wait for iphone 19.
Bro just bought a Porsche 911 and revealed casually Lol 😂.
Unsubbing.
Congratulations on the car!
iSheep spotted
Marques is a Barca guy! Wow!
"I upgraded to the 15 Pro last week after using the SE 2 since 2020, it makes a huge difference!"
Marques can you give me that FCB OVO jersey. You'll be saving my life😢
I need that wallpaper 😢
"Is this video just Marques flexing. We get it, you’re a multimillionaire at a young age."
"my Long Term use is 3months......









and 10 years."
Does it worth it to change a google pixel 7 pro to the iphone 15 pro max? Or mayve i should wait for the iphone 16 to get out in a year ???
Visca Barca ❤💙
"""I never use Siri""
On the face of Apple😅😂"
Visca barca
"What kit is on your 911? By the way, another dope and informative vid!"
I could say that something about the video quality was off as I was watching it in 4k and it is a little different compared to the red Raptor camera
We want long term reviews
Força Barça
i did the same. used my action button for camera for quick snaps.
Didn’t know marques was a Culer
The last sentence got me shocked!!
"I upgraded to the 15 pro from an X and I completely agree with your conclusions! I told myself I would not upgrade to the new iPhone until Apple added USB C, and I'm glad I followed through. Different camera modes are silly... just use the 1x and crop in post. Action button was very promising, but the placement isn't ideal (sometimes I briefly confuse it for the volume up, when I'm not looking at it), also different actions on the lockscreen vs homescreen would be a nice improvement. The dynamic island is a nice way to show ongoing notifications; it reminds me of Android's statusbar notification icons. The materials and construction of the phone is beautiful (except the thicc camera bump). I miss the sleekness of the X, but the new one is not too bad for a larger phone."
"Using the action button for the camera is a nice idea, especially if you're already using the phone and want to instantly get it open to take a picture on the fly. I'm not much of a pictures guy so I just have it mapped for Discord. I appreciate it being there."
Surprised to sse that the video shot on iPhone
Still using iphone 6s 16Gb 8yrs old.
lol 3 months. I'm using my XR for the past 2 years and 8 months. Let's see a youtuber actually use a phone for more than a year and then do a review. 3 months is nothing.
Mkbhd apple fan boy😂
waiting for a studio video about how you shot this video !
Cropping a photo of the pixel 8 phone of the year award…. You know what you did 😂
"Please bro I don't mean to beg but if you can help me with your MacBook Pro m2 14, in my country macs are very expensive and I can't afford it. I am a developer and I need that laptop so if you can please help in any way I would much appreciate it"
Ooo yeah that's why I was like dude the red's quality is degraded 🙂. But in fact it was a filthy iPhone 🙂. And mark I thought you liked the environment because of your video about the solar panels and Tesla. Naah why'd you buy a 911. You dirty two faces.
Pretty lookin' dashing today mkbhd. Espanol today.  Barcelona🤳🏻
I watched the video twice to confirm if what you said is true about shooting this video on iphone 15 and ended up seeing reflections of iphone 15 pro  you actually used to shoot the video.
ok u love barc
Wow that surprised me that it was shot on iPhone. Do yall just perfect the lighting to make it look good like this?
"Marques, are you a Barcelona fan?😂"
Hala Madrid
Which weather application is Marques using?
Its my 30th and my 2nd iphone after 3G 😂
If you have a 3D TV or projector then you can convert spatial video to SBS 3D and watch it on your TV/Projector
What app is that weather widget for?
is 128gb on 15 pro enough without using icloud?
Actually notcied the video was not as good as always. Your skin tone was lighter this time around too.
911? Like the terrorist attack? What does that mean?
Anyone know what the weather app he's using at 6:26 is?
may i ask what is that weather app called?
"The ending was unexpected, woahhh!"
Apple should allowed the action button  do multiple things not just one things
Iphone 15 pro is rubbish and useless !!!!!
which weather app is he using looks different?
I think Apple has planned to give USB C to the pro version since they have put the fast transfer speed in the new A17 pro and I'm sure that took years of planning. For the regular 15? That one we can thank EU for that.
Happy Birthday
How has the battery life been for you?
apple really did everything right with the 15 pro/ max line up. love everything on my ip15promax
I should've stuck with P instead of the  PM but there's always next year 😅.
Why do you show a staircase in the backdrop? That makes me anxious... what if you drop that costly phone?
Happy Birthday!!
"Actually, in the early video, I noticed something different about the sharpness in your face, and the blur or bokeh in your hair.. then, ""Okay, it gotta be from iPhone"""
"Thank god the review wasn’t bad, just bought mine yesterday. I do feel a little disappointed by the battery tho"
BIG up Marques ❤ With the Barcelona Kit ❤❤
"It took me a few seconds to process that I was seeing a Windows wallpaper on the Mac at 5:05.

I go caseless with my iPhones as well, but I haven't ever had problems with the front glass getting scratched. No screen coverings either. I'm careful to always keep it in a place where there is nothing to scratch it though, my keys go in a different pocket for example. The sides always seem to get scratches, but so far the titanium seems to be doing well,  or I have been."
I see a barcelona jersey so i know its fake news
Next level Youtubography!!🎉🎉
"Amazing review, thanks!"
I have the action button set to open the fronk on my Rivian
what is the weather app?
One cable to charge and one cable to rule them all.
"What’s crazy for me is how long I’ve kept my action button set to the flash light. Being a recluse who spends a lot of time in the dark, not having to turn on the screen and long press on the Home Screen has been a game changer."
Why u gotta be a Barca fan bruh
Very presumptuous of you to assume that my eyes aren't one on top of the other.
noooooo way that was shot on the iphone holy shit dude

Wait! What! Did he say the whole video was with the IPhone 15? Dang
Lmao I told myself “what if this was shot in the 15 Pro like the scary fast trailer” and boy did I freak out
That Barça jersey suits you @MKBHD
We need a BTS on how this video was shot. The motion blur looks amazing. Did you use an ND filter adapter for these shots?
Happy birthday
That iphone looks so tiny in your gigantic hand!
Happy birthday Marques
"I’ve been using the 5x way more than I expected on my 15 Pro Max, the cameras in general are just incredible"
Barca 😮
It's insane that this video was all shot on an iPhone. Wow! with good lighting it's as good as the other MKBHD videos!
Flippity Doo-da was a game changer for me because it lets you set different things to happen on your iPhone based on how your iPhone is oriented like if my iPhone is in landscape with the action button facing up my camera opens and I have other things happen but I’d love it that it is totally customizable and gives you versatility to action button!
"The most important is you have the t-shirt of the best team ever. Regards from Spain, bro!"
"People who carry 2 phones: 
Marques Brownlee,
Mental health therapists, 
Walter White"
Bro what is happening to your neck?
"From now on, I'll be listening to the podcast for future video ideas because I remember how Marques said he wanted to do a video the same (or similar) way that Apple did the Halloween event."
"Best part was ""entire shot on 15 pro""😅"
"Bro, i honestly think you will look better in Real Madrid kit"
Hala Madrid Marques 🖐️😂
Dose anyone know what that weather app is
on 2:24 and already can say this video was shoot by phone camera : p
I could tell it was shot on iPhone but definitely not because it looks bad...
whole video shot on iphone 15 pro is WILD!!!!
Visca Barca!
The 911 was a good flex. Am thirty too and can't get close to affording one. Cheets
"Marques, now we need you to shoot a video on Pixel 8 under similar conditions for a comparison!"
We need a video on how going from an EV to an ICE vehicle has changed your vehicle management
So are the battery issues all fixed ?
yo what weather app are you using at 9:12?
"upgraded from iPhone X. the X did me well for a long time, but I'm glad I waited to upgrade til now. Really enjoying this phone."
Can anyone tell me what wallpaper it is and where I can get it?
Is 128gb enough for this phone?
"I have the action button start preconditioning my Tesla. Super quick, super convenient, especially in this weather. @mkbhd"
🤯
Which weather app is that?
Let’s see a review of your beautiful new 911 😎
"The fact that I saw no difference from this iPhone filmed video and your usual videos made me realize that it's not always the camera, but the person(s) controlling the camera.😳 Nicely shot 👏"
that 911 tho <3
Fun fact you can actually side load videos meant for the Vision Pro onto the meta quest 3 and watch it there
Go Barça
"I am surprised I DID notice something was off about the video.

To be precise, the light on the first half of the video was a little weird to the point I thought ""man, even Marques is getting tired of 2023, man's lazy these days"""
ABSOLUTELY AMAZING W PORSCHE 911 AND CAMERA WORK
"Happy Birthday!! And congrats on the Porsche, the matte black looks dope"
What weather app does he use in 9:07?
"@mbkhd PLEASE READ! There’s a widespread unreported emerging issue that needs media attention. Of SHARP EDGES ISSUE ON THE 15 Pro models! Unacceptable on a $2199 phone ! It’s a slap in the face to expect us to accept this & Irresponsible of Apple to dare advertise smoother edges & then ship sharp misaligned phones that have obvious assembly issues & expect us to stay silent !? Even after multiple replacements months later it’s still the same. Issue is worldwide & more so maybe on the natural. We need someone with your influence to please help bring attention to this issue & force Apple to acknowledge & take responsibility to provide a phone that DOESN’T scratch us who go without a case & some are wondering if it affects water resistance ? Side note, I’ve received first releases up until recent replacements & the build quality & colour has improved which is another issue. The people with first releases were given dull crappier natural colour & tone & build compared to later batches. I’d suggest that’s also included in your hopeful video too. I’ve learnt my lesson for sure, never get a new release device, especially as popular as iPhone within the first few months of release. They must pump them out in order to reach their targets at the expense of quality. Which is disappointing & disrespectful to those who pay top dollar for their device. 
Anyways 1st world problem I know but still… hope this gets the attention it needs, WE the customers need to make a difference & speak up about things like this. I’m not expecting perfection but not fair that some devices have it & others don’t, especially when paying so much, it doesn’t sit right. So if you’re affected or care then pls make some noise ! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
+ Keep up the great work to u & the team, enjoy & respect your content long time 😏 ✌🏼"
"The amount of flexing that occurred in 10 minutes was miraculously extravagant, to say the least. 💪"
"i am a new iphone 15 user, here is the annoying thing. the faceid isn't better than a fingerprint reader embedded into the phone, i physically have to look everytime to unlock the phone everytime and giant hole punch to accommodate the sensors for it is equally annoying."
i upgraded from a 12 pro to the 15 pro and this is probably the first time ive actively pulled out my phone to take photos during gatherings with friends which is something ive never done before. something about the camera just makes the point and shoot feel worth it to use regularly
What is the weather app he uses with the black cloud bc looks nice I want it.
The jersey 😍
nicely done Mr.markass brownie
Please make more long term reviews
WTF? REALLY ENTIRE VIDEO?
If apple increase the pro size 6.2/3 that will be perfect they can fir bigger battery and more zoom.
Merry Christmas and Happy Belated Birthday Marques🎂🎁🎄
happy birthday
"If there's a 15 mini Pro, then yes. For now, I'm keeping my 13 mini."
What wallpaper is that?
"@mkbhd  PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, STOP SHOOTING ON THE STAIRS, YOU'RE MAKING US ANXIOUS !!!!"
congrats on turning 30🙂🙂
"Dude forgot, the Nokia used to have these ""camera button"" on side panels XD"
i use only iphone 15 pro with only 128Gigs for 2 weeks in japan. Use USB-C to move photo and video everyday. its neat
"But MKBHD always love big screen phones since he has ""big hands"" (he said so himself 😅) . So he always went for ""Pro-max"" model every year. Why chosse only ""pro"" this time!!!"
"But the sound quality on iphone 15 pro max with apple headset is totally totally sucks! :( C'mon apple, what give?"
"Apple is losing money with the ban of Apple Watches. 

MKBHD, say no more. Imma make another video on your new crappy phone that breaks even though you tout the glass to be unbreakable."
"Congratulations on the insane purchase brother
Its high time that you pampered yourself
The spec is awesome
Keep on rising my man 💪"
The last twistttt
What’s the weather app Marques is using in this video?
The phone looked boring until Mark said that the whole video was shot on iPhone 15 Pro! It is so good!
"lighter than 14 pro ,? okay how much weighs this different from predecessor?"
"I am left handed and the action button is perfect aside from me wanting a double click, triple click, long press"
Apple Log is impressive. They have the colors so good.
"Nice. I got my midlife crisis car at 36 (this year, back in June)."
What weather widget is that?
Love the Barça shirt
"I recently got an iphone 15 pro and it was amazing. One thing you do with the action button is get the current volume, wait 700 milliseconds and then see if the old volume is the same as the new one. if it is you can make it do something else. That makes it basically a double press by pressing the action button then a volume button."
"Watching on my iphone 15 pro max. It would be future proof if they included a better battery pack. It least I expect, Apple to give a software update to make it less power hungry. My 1 year old 350$ android gives better battery backup. Smh 👤"
Guys still on the Justin maller backgrounds !!! Iykyk
"Today I had a weird dream I went to my relatives house and there they had a tunnel like opening in the room itself lol and then suddenly mkbhd told me to use flashlight on the hole and I saw a bunch of phone and instantly crawled inside the hole and took a iPhone xr and iphone 11 with me and I got out the screen was cracked but still I got a new phone sadly as I was crawling my way out, I realised that this was a dream 😢"
A football shirt 🫤
"You surprised me by doing just like apple did with their keynote, shot on iPhone. Also didn't expect the Porsche 911 reveal. Congratulations."
nice t shirt
"Finally, you shot an entire video on the iPhone and I gotta say I couldn’t notice a difference from all the other videos on the channel."
No update for me this year coz using 13 pro😢
Quality video as always.
'Its about damn time' for that Porsche
"Congrats on the Porsche 911, looks DOPE ✨"
"I didn't notice the video was shot on iphone until I rewatched the video, but when i did, i noticed the difference, but until then I couldn't tell that's pretty good."
Coming from a base model 11 to the 15 Pro I was very happy
"Best shortcut I’ve seen is one called MultiButton, letting you set 2 or 3 shortcuts from clicking the Action Button repeatedly in a short time. I set one click to toggle Silent Mode, and 2 to bring up my most used Shortcuts in a list."
"Wireless charging is like a Tesla, it's not good for the environment."
"Holy cow, SHOT ON AN IPHONE 15 PRO?? This truly is so inspiring for Smartphone videographers out there. thank you so much Mr Brownlee. Keep up the good work."
What’s that weather app you are using?
"Brother had praised iPhone 15 Pro in the previous video, so Apple asked to re-make the video.and also he shoot this video with iphone 15 pro 😂"
"wow, the video is great. can't belive this is shot by iPhone 15 Pro"
Wallpaper link please.
"glad I decided to switch to the 15pro max from an iphone 11. Been loving it so much, def a great upgrade"
Forca barca 💙❤️
"can you show us your camera settings, and other settings in your iphone?"
"Monopoly iPhone not affordable for all people 

Come on, if you iPhone If there is pride then what is happening in this country just to sing the praises of a company why is it necessary for people to get into debt and buy a product at a price that all people can afford?"
"The video quality is actually fantastic but what's good w the background noise, was audio used from the 15 pro too?"
Congrats on the 911 Turbo S. Now join the NEDC 🙃
I also had a “cut” like the one at 0:56 on my iPhone 12 display. Apple still paid full price for it when I traded it in for an iPhone 15. Anybody have a similar experience?
Read my mind.. just bought a 15 Pro on Christmas Eve and I cant decide if I should exchange it for a base 15...looks like they have better battery life?
That 911 looks sweet. Congrats!
"Yeah, coming from an iPhone 11 Pro, it’s a great upgrade! Nice review Marques"
"I went from an iPhone X to 15 pro and really still think I’m
On the X sometime when on 15 pro as far  screen picture quality   Not much different. I expected more of a leap in picture quality ( it’d been 6 years) and not sure if I notice a difference even as far as higher refresh rate.  Sorry. Granted, there are better features but worth it?"
I never would've realized this was shot on the 15 Pro.
Barcelona got free advertising
"Oh hey, congrats on the Porsche!

Enjoy it. Flat-6/10"
Visca Barca ❤💙
Real Madrid forever ❤❤
I wonder if it would be possible to watch the spacial videos (and i assume spacial photos are a thing) one's 3DS. lol
Google assistant in place of siri😅
"The end of this video was DOPE. The story telling and gradual reveals, it was all movie esque. Salute on your Porsche 911 pick up! Life is good and you labors been payin off BIG TIME!!!"
As soon as the video started I just knew it was filmed on the 15. The iPhone 15 launch I think has me conditioned. The depth and sharpness is vastly different from a Red.
Bro give me your wallpaper man!!! Just give it!!
my action button is the most forgotten button… i don’t even use it and i set it to launch whatsapp but not sure why i always look for the app instead of using the action button😅 it’s actually redundant
"With increasing spam calls, I have used action button for search Truecaller. Otherwise action button has been moot. 

P.S. Truecaller on ios is shit. This is my first iPhone.. I have been an ios user.

Some things I miss coming from android

- Calculator 
- Truecaller
- Pausing a video and then continuing with same video
- Taking pic while recording in cinematic mode


Things I like
- I feel my data is much more secure.
- camera in certain settings captures better pictures"
Swiping across the Dynamic Island is a pro tip. Thank you!
I wonder if Vision Pro video shot on iPhone are going to be very slightly worse quality in one eye since it’s used by the ultra wide camera instead of the main lens
Is the voice also recorded on iPhone Pro?
Why does the lip movement and Audio seem out of sync.
🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
"Can you do a detailed video of the camera performance, there wasn't much about the camera."
That wallpaper is gorgeous
Visca Barsa
"After years of being loyal to android, I’ve finally decided to break up and made the switch to IPhone 15 pro max. It’s a little bit of a learning curve but so far loving the phone. Not overwhelming myself just learning a little bit at a time of all the features and capabilities. Videos like these help tremendously"
Really appreciate the detail and dedication towards covering every single feature. The part about spatial videos sounds interesting. Makes me look forward to how this tech evolves.
"Whenever the staircase shot came, I felt like he was about to throw the phone and show how strong it was🤣"
"With me being primarily left handed using my 15 pro, the action button is in the perfect spot"
6:41 . Marques been checking out Olivia dunne. hahahaah
8:58 😂 🤝.
Loving the Barcelona support @mkbhd ❤💙
Bro dropped 2 bangers in the last 2 minutes of the video 💥
Today was the day I put a case on my iPhone 15 Pro Max due to me dropping over the holiday break from work (too drunk lol) the edge started feeling rough to hold so I found a pretty solid transparent case I can still show off the titanium grey and feels a lot better to hold.
I mapped my action button to the mute switch.
dog!!!
"i had an 11 pro and this was a great upgrade, anything 13 and above definitely isnt worth it though"
"""Quick toggle to better assistant"" Ouchhhhh 😂😂"
Can you please make a video on iPhone 15 Plus.
"I just got my iPhone 15 pro max NT a week ago. I already love the not many fingerprints on the Ti case, the NT color is the way to go unless you have to get the Blue or Black, I think the best action button options are: mute switch, flashlight, Translate and Shortcut. I use Shortcut for My Hyundai on my IONIQ 6 starting the EV as well as do many other things quick within the app. Overall I would say my favorite IPPMX is the 13 Pro Max. It lasted all day long on barely a charge and the software was key. My 2nd would be the IP15PMX only because the changes aspects about it. The row our is bigger screens by .20 inches next edition so that may be a big upgrade for many."
Great summary after some time. I use my action button the same. I still feel I’m jumped to the 15 pro max from the 10sMax. Happy holidays 😊
I probably have watched too much of your content that I noticed that something was kinda odd since the beginning of this video. I'm impressed
Congratulations on the car! 911 Turbo S?
Can you talk about the battery experience as well in the next video?
No updates on Video Boost !?
5:59 I hope you still sort of realize most people can’t afford—or are generally unwilling and justly so—to instantly purchase a new iteration of their otherwise perfectly functional hardware once a USB-C version becomes available? Yes? Thanks! 🙏
"At first I thought the team missed the exposure on the Red, but I realised that Marques is pulling off an Apple for his iPhone review"
Idk I’m good with my 12 for another few years
Glad to hear I picked a good year to upgrade my 8 😂
this video is a certified hood classic
"Hi @mkbhd I m android  user 
Talk about"
What is the name of the weather app
upvote for the Barca jersey!
Forca barca 💙❤️
"Mark, Belated Happy Birthday Wishes from India😊"
Does anyone have that wallpaper?? From this video?
I don’t have the spacial video option in my settings and I got iPhone 15 pro max.. welp
Can you shoot a video with s23 ultra 8k
Wow you got the 911! Low key Flex!!!!
Congratulations on the new Porsche 😮
I am disappointed coz i was expecting you to talk about the battery life 😐😐😐
why barcelona
"I've had my 15 Pro since launch also and I absolutely love it. The past few iPhones we got several highlight features that I had been waiting for (blue color, 120Hz, Dynamic Island etc). This phone has all of those things on top of the new titanium build, USB C, and just feeling in general like the iPhone perfected. I plan to hang onto this one for a while."
Shoutout to Barca jersey ❤
Wow use a screen protector bro
Can we please get a review of the car on autofocus
why doesnt his settings ui have the typical grey grouping? can you customize that?
Marques in Barca shirt ❤
"I upgraded from the iPhone 12 to the iPhone 15 Pro and I can say it is totally worth it. The dynamic island is really fun to use when using different Apps. Also, the Cinematic Video option is pretty neat"
"you made like 8 videos for iphone 15 by now & 2 videos for pixel 8... bravo, very unbiased"
Now do iPhone 3(gs) 15 years later ;)
Nice surprise at the end: 10:10
"Heyyy, how did you managed to get that depth of field, was it shot in PRORES LOG witg external lens attachment?"
Video Bomb: Coffee man with Black Dog 😂
barcelonaaaaa
Barca fans?
"Hey !  Where is the list of the winners of the 100 ONE PLUS phones raffle YOU PROMOTED some months ago????

WAS IT A SCAM TO GET OUR PERSONAL DETAILS?"
I think the only thing missing for this video is a black pro-mist filter. Because the only thing giving away that this was shot on a phone is that digital sharpness which a pro-mist can solve pretty well. However I’m not sure how effective it will be in front of a small phone lens.
What a review and congrats on the ride. Everything ties together so well almost made me think you bought the Porsche to complement the video hehe
Wow 😮
"Lil bro grew up , he started with a boring Tesla now look at him"
Now I need a video on the 911
You have kept the classic wallpaper from the time you started reviewing gadgets.Nice…felt nostalgic 💯
I love the shirt!
This was shot entirely on iPhone 25 Pro. Say no more!! This is a video camera first telephone. I'm glad I opted for iPhone 15 Pro Max with 1TB storage space.
Best in the game. Love your stuff man
Barcelona !!!!! Really?🥲
“The more you know” fantastic throwback! Love your videos and content.
"Regarding NEEDING an Apple Vision Pro to view spatial videos. This is false, you can view them on a Quest 3 headset (and maybe other headsets too, I just have the 3). There are videos out there detailing this. They look cool, very 3D. The limiting factor is the FOV of the videos, it is very narrow. So Don't expect full VR immersion with the videos."
Visca el Barca
"After seeing this, I'm all too glad that I bought 13 Pro 1TB last month instead.
I had wanted to get the 15 Pro 1 Tb if not for its obnoxious pricing.

Those new features in 15 Pro are nice but I'll take 1TB storage any day for close to half its price. ;).
NOT having to rely on internet connectivity for my files storage just feels so liberating day in day out.

I will of course get the 15 / 16 Pro later, in 3-4 years time perhaps."
Barcelona! 🎉🏝️🎄
@mkbhd can you please do a long term review of S23 Ultra
Nice shirt
911 ❤️‍🔥
great video! more of these please
Didn’t expect marquees to be a Barcelona fan 👀
Dope drop as usual. Where did you get that backpack? It’s clean and unique
FCB is big L
Barca Jersey...🤦🏾‍♂️
"This is actually the second time a video has been shot on the iPhone 15 pro...truly incredible, the camera on the iPhone 15 pro is just insane!!"
What a flex! Congrats on new car!
"Oooh that was smooth. But believe it or not, i know the team has spent a lot more time color correcting the proRAW footage to match MKBHD style videos but its ever so slightly different. The hues and the visible  depth of field were different. 
But the results are honestly amazing."
thanks for featuring my reel🫶🏼
can u find a phone with high graphics performance batery and with a big screen and a watch that works like a phone
Are we going to have BTS?? 😜😜
That Blaugrana shirt is 🔥🔥🔵🔴
"I see Barcelona i subscribe 🖤🖤

Pin me❤"
Happy belated Birthday and congratulations on the Porsche. The 911 is my dream car 💯💯
You didn’t tell anything about the battery life
"Getting my iPhone 15 Pro tomorrow hehe. I come from iPhone 12 Mini, which I've had it fine with, but since my phone is the last hardware I have, which is not USB-C, I'm upgrading.
I wish they still did Mini's though, but it is what it is :/"
visca barca😂🫀
"Explains why the video looked so bad.. it looked somehow over defined. Like facial lines, curves... it just didn't look professional"
"I didnt know iphones didnt have the ""double press power to open camera"" like androids have. Apple really is slow."
visca barca visca Catalunya
How come you aren't using the 15 Pro Max?
That barcelona Jersey ❤
Every shot was shot on iPhone 15 Pro Max??? Damn I really didn’t expect that coming
"What weather widget and app is this? Another great video (shot on the iPhone was huge), and loving the new long term review. Thank you for the excellence."
"Ok. Now Ihue agree that the iPhone video is the best. Like what !!!!😯I thought he was using his professional camera, except for some shots looking a bit orange, but i didn't think it was all shot noth iPhone 15 pro"
Bro you're looking fly with the goatee. Shave off the sides though
"I was skeptical from the start of the video that there was something wrong with the video quality and artificial bokeh, and it was shot with an iPhone."
You didnt talk about battery health
🔵🔴 Visca El Barca 🔵🔴
"Never expected you to be a Barcelona fan 😂, im a fan too ❤"
dude just causually bought a porsche for his 30 
This video is great - also please do this more often - you producing CLEAN videos on a phone is great for newcomers. Remind them that a phone is all you need at the start
Why did you choose the 15 pro over the pro max? I know you usually like to rock the bigger phones. Also I hope to see a video like this for your pixel in the future loved the follow up review!
What is the name of the weather app that appear on the phone of Marques?
"This video doesn't really compare iphone 15 pro vs pro max, I wish there was a part where you explained why you went with the smaller pro vs the bigger pro max"
We want a whole series of your new 911 on the Autofocus channel. Congratulations and Happy Birthday!
Mkbhd is getting gray hair in his beard :(....
Waveform podcast listeners weren't surprised at all 😂😂
"I found that why the quality is not appearing that I come here to see, and I surprised that why you use 15 pro rather than 15 Pro Max?"
I turned 30 this year... Might need to get a 911 too lol
"Barca, Barca, Barca 🎉"
Its ok to put screen protector. And case should be optional. So you can appreciate the beauty of the phone without case
I'm stuck with a iPhone se 2020😢
3:18 was where is spotted the plot twist. The sharp skin details and minimal bokeh is what tipped me off.
Wow
he has a robot arm! it's in thee background. did yall see it. it's a robot arm!
I kinda figured that it would take a video about the iPhone 15 Pro for them to try out shooting a video with the iPhone 15 Pro. Great job!
"You thanked Europe for the USB Type C, But actually this idea was initiated by INDIA, You should thank India too"
"USB-C and thanking europe is such a sad comment and bad praise. 
If you didn't like that the iPhone didn't have usb-c, don't use it. Why is that concept so hard to grasp? You like cars, lets use cars. I don't like that Jeep puts their window switches in the dash. Even though every other car puts it on the door. Should I petition the US to make a law for switches on doors? No. I just don't buy a Jeep. Every previous iPhone user was fine with having lighting because they had 10 years of lightning laying around their house. The same way that android users have 7ish years of USB-C laying around. It was a choice."
My 15 pro takes flawless video
I'm waiting for this review only from MKBHD. Thanks to you!
Bro got the Garuda Linux wallpaper
nice car man!
Try real madrid shirt next time
my 15 pro max is case less and the camera ring has some serious wear on its glass that is showing up whitish and the bottom corners of the phone where the glass is on the back is also wearing. other then that its been fine.
What’s that wallpaper?
The white color is just perfect
Happy Birthday bro!!! Porsche was inspiring for sure! Keep goin !!! 🚀🚀🚀🚀
I 100% expected thé “shot on an iPhone” thing. I just had a hunch that it would be the case and it look pretty dang good.
"IMHO, do not upgrade this year. Wait for next year. I think most likely Apple will then push all the ""Pro"" features to the non-pro models. For example, USB 3.0 will also be available to iPhone 16 too next year."
"not sure if it's my headphones, but it sounds like your Ts and Ss are more pitchy, like you need a pop filter or something."
Congrats on getting a 911!!! It suits you pretty nicely
3:25  it’s not hard to reach if you’re a lefty
Nice way of tell the world that you got 911 for yourself . Congratulations
Alternative title: I said IPhones are like Porches so I bought a Porsche
❤
I disabled the action button. I kept hitting it all the time when I didn’t want to. Now my phone just feels like I lost the silent mode feature switch.
What weather app is he using???
Why don't you upgrade to the Bose QC Ultras or the Sony XM5s
Wasn’t expecting you to hit us with that last line and say it was shot on an iPhone absolutely amazing!
I use my action button for Shazam
Waiting for your Bose QC Ultra review.
I upgraded my iPhone from the XS Max to the 15 Pro Max. The only difference I notice on a regular basis is the longer battery life 🤷🏿‍♂️
Care to share the wallpaper? It would make my day 🙏
A barca fan I see
Happy 30th birthday brudda!
What about battery life?
MKBHD is Culé.
Does that include your talking head portions? When you say shot on iPhone?????
This is unexpected twist can't believe it
"Upgraded from an XS. Found the battery life is only slightly better than a significantly degraded 5 year old battery in the XS. Also pretty unimpressed with the camera. I’m finding my partner’s 13 Pro produces better pictures, particularly those with any slight zoom. Definitely not worth what I paid for it."
Congrats on the 911 Marques! Fucking awesome to see you got one!
15 pro or 15 pro max is the real question ;)
"Since I have a ton of different devices I use throughout the day and I pretty much always have my airpod pros in, I changed the action button to a shortcut that connects my airpod pros to the iPhone and sets the volume at 50%. I use this all the time! Really convenient when listening to something on my computer then get a call."
"""every single shot was shoot on iphone 15 pro"" - most powerful words from a techyoutuber."
I have the 14 Pro Max I usually upgrade every 3 years.. not every 3 models.. 3 years. Thats been working ok.
"Lets talk about the 911 More what happened, it an obvious choice but i thought you don't drive for fun seeing is you are all electric. 

Excellent choice by the way which 911?"
Is anyone else having problems with portraits on the iPhone 15 pro max?  Mine and my gf's units have a lot of trouble selection subjects in lower light situations in portrait mode ( that didnt happen on our iPhone 14 )
That was a flex wow.. a Porshe  at the end..  😅
Love the FCBarcalona shirt
Barca fans represent !
Barcelona? Why ?
It impressive to see it was shot on an iphone 15 👏
Classic wallpaper
Marques appreciating the 9/11 strategy 💀
Can someone please tell me what's that weather app he uses?
"the crop ""feature"" has turned on at least 100 times for me (especially when zooming in on videos), and I've never once intended to use it. I wish Apple got their heads out their asses and let us turn that ""feature"" off. Was probably thought up by an engineer trying to make themself seem useful"
Just traded up to one of these the day after Christmas from the 14 Pro. Wasn’t sure if the upgrade would be worth it but so far it has been for me. Also going mostly caseless for the first time in years. It’s finally light enough and not a fingerprint magnet and just easier to hold. Love it a lot.
Why's Marques wearing a Barcelona jersey?🤔
I been seeing the Barca jersey alot..more big fan and it looks beautiful with u ❤
You made me watch your video twice just to look back on how the 15 Pro was used to take this whole video 😂
"You said that the video was shot on the Iphone 15 pro at the end but right from the beginning of the video I can tell that there is something wrong, I think that's the sharpening and the flare on your face."
"Spacial video is only available on iPhone 15 Pro, not iPhone 15"
FC Barcelona 💙❤ thats a W
beautiful barcelona jersey🔥
Visça Barça ❤️💙
Ok do long term review like this of the s23 ultra
"Happy birthday Marques! love the car, you deserve it"
happy 30th Marques! cant wait to change my XS to the 15 pro max 🥲
ChatGPT on the Action Button is the best thing ever
Amazing that it's iphone 15 pro ! I thought it was the 'RED' camera and congratulations for  the 911 !!!!!
"With a vpn YouTube doesn't allow me to comment, it's today that I discovered it, For the love of you I'm gonne be commenting I love you on every video,  much love from Uganda 🇺🇬 ❤"
"AKA you dont have any other content, and you are squeezing the iphone for content"
Well you really know how to end a video 💯
"Plot twist of : shot on iphone, was insane😂"
Happy 30th birthday...... wishing you a blessed year ahead.
Sweet ride dude! Happy 30 🎉
The iPhone 15 pro looks great with the matte glass and single glass on the back. The small tweaks to the design is a good call with the smoother edges.
"I love my iPhone and appreciate Apple's move towards building phones with a lower carbon footprint. The fact that they chose to use titanium for the band is laughable, considering that a big reason Titanium is so expensive is because it's incredibly resource intensive to refine and extract. They should just use recycled aluminum or carbon fibre. All I can hope is, as demand for the metal continues to grow they are able to find more efficient ways to refine and extract it."
Your videos are really great
I knew it was only a matter of time before you got the 911 :)
I have the iPhone 11 Pro Max right now. Should I upgrade to the 15 pro? Worth it or not?
Define much older iphones
❤
"can I just say you look GREAT for 30, holy smokes! that's wild, I watched you grow up from a teenager, dang what a journey!!"
"omg you're my age woah, I love seeing your videos (as having worked on the mechanical/manufacturing engineering backend on some of big tech) happy belated birthday!!!"
What is the app he uses for that weather widget?
"Camera for action button is best choice imo. The current shortcuts are too clunky on iOS and you can miss the moment especially with kids. On Android the double click power button is perfect, you can turn on the camera while your phone is still in your pocket and it’s ready to shoot by time you have it out, iPhone doesn’t have an equivalent until now. Just wish the action button was above the power button rather than the mute switch."
What is the name of weather app?
Can we have a pixel 8 pro 3 months review?
We not gonna talk about that battery huh?
We ❤️ you
I did not realise for a second this was shot on the iPhone! Seems like you don’t need those big boy cameras anymore bro
Marques with barca shirt 👌👌😘
"anyone else casually notice the $250,000 lamp ?"
didnt know you were a barcenola fan
Love the Barça t shirt
How's the battery life?
"""Every single shot was shot on an 15 pro""… I actually noticed abnormality in the color spectrum than your usual videos... I figured it's an iphone but not sure which one!"
Can we get a BTS of shooting with the iPhone?
"Can anyone tell me, what weather app is MKBHD using?"
i thought i was gone upgrade my 13 pro max to the 15 pro max i think ima just stick to this phone i don’t see a reason to upgrade at this point nothing really exciting
Action button to show a bunch of actions is the best
8:50 exactly 1 year later you found it🎉🎉🎉
visca barça
"every single shot including A roll or ""talking head"" no way lol"
Great video but the best thing about it was the barca jersy
Guy has a 911 and says its not flashy 😭😭😭😭😭😭
"But the screen scratches easily, easier than my old iPhone 12, which basically forces you to deal with screen protectors."
Omg 😅 I thought red camera like every video
Sweet sweet 911
"Belated birthday wishes, Marques!!!"
"Garbage phone.

Come to the darkside, bro. Android is where it's at."
"Dude will make all videos in the world to avoid ""what's on my phone 2023""."
Marquees disappointed me with that Barcelona jersey 😢
"I always use 1x, 2x and 5x, simply because they are exact pixels, and will always be a clearer picture than in-between ones."
"I just wanted to point out something most reviewers missed on the A17 Pro chip when it comes to actual gaming. 

I mostly game on my iphone and own a 13 pro max and its been running all games perfectly on 120fps mode without any frame drops. 

But I wanted a new phone and got the 15 pro max and legit is not optimized for any games, 120fps mode is not allowed, getting terrible performance and barely reaching 60 fps in most games etc. 

This phone also runs hot when gaming, its gotten to the point where I returned my phone and just played on my 13 pro max which has none of these issues, it gets warm but not hot, has optimized game settings and access to 120fps mode. 

If you are serious about gaming on your phone just avoid this chip for gaming, while its more powerful its not worth the extra heat and none optimized gaming you get. 

This also applies to m2 Ipad, while most games have been optimized for m1, m2 will run hot and not have access to 120fps mode. 

You can easily test this out yourself with wildrift, this game showcases my frustrations perfectly with the A17 Pro chip.

I know most people will scroll past this post but just wanted to share."
6:25 what weather app is this
You have to do a review on the 911
"Man, this was fimed on 15 pro, if u dint tell us... Bcuz the quality is superb"
2XCombo in the end of the video 😂♥️
"Guys the main shot was shot in a phone ??? Not that it looks bad, but doesn't look RED, am I crazy??"
"The quality of this video is fucking brazy… this can’t be the iPhone by itself, dawg. Can’t be. 

I also love the Porsche! And the iPhone."
varcelona
"I don’t like people ignoring the subtle Porsche 911 flex even if it is an iPhone review.
Congratulations Marques."
Which weather app is it?
Just like the Apple event. We want a behind the scenes on the studio channel on shooting this video entirely on the iPhone 15 pro.
Congrats!!!
"7:35 ""because your eyes are next to each other not on top of each other"".
It made me laugh, I'm so silly."
Glory supporting Varca 😂
"I hope more people talk about this. They still have not fixed a major camera issue on the wide camera. Take a photo of a wordy document or subject with letters over it, and you will realize that on the pro version, only the middle is sharp; the rest is blurry. You could see the post-processing failed to map the letters properly, resulting in a ghosting image.

Quite often, 15 Pro failed to use its LiDAR to detect the object, which creates a partial blurry effect on the object. Coming from 13 Pro Max, 15 Pro is truly a disappointment."
Hala Madrid.
At 1:12 your hands are MASSIVE!
That Vision Pro experience flex 💪
"3:05
as a LEFT handed person, for me personally the placement of the Action button is quite suitable. 😊"
I don’t think those Apple video pluggings are shot on iPhone 😜
Now do this format for the S23 series.
Good to see Marques in an FC Barcelona jersey!
Am I tripping its a pro right not a pro Max only pro Max were made with titanium
I just sold my 13pro and got a new 15pm two days ago😂
"naa, that's called a flex right there in the end"
Cute doggo on the background at 6:14
Nice wheels
My Action Button is configured to toggle the flashlight and honestly I use it ALL the time.
Nice jersey bro
I want deep analysis of blind smartphone camera test
Customizable button is not out of place for us lefties.
Hala Madrid 🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍
"I has using an iphone 8 plus and decided to change it for an iPhone 15 pro max, no regrets. Great phone"
"Me, who still using the iPhone 6"
bro called a 911 boring
I had a feeling this was not shot on one of those expensive RED cameras but I still was kinda doubting. Nice review
great video
Bro I could tell that these videos didn’t look like RED video. I just wasn’t sure. But I had a feeling it was iPhone footage. Was this still shot on LOG?
You lost me with your shirt! HALA MADRID!!
Ngl coming from the se 2020 I was expecting much more than what was offered. No rush to upgrade people other than a new action button and upgraded cameras which aren’t even that good compared to the se this iPhone ain’t that impressive.
my girl upgraded from the 11 to the 15 pro max and we both love the 15 pm. it gives both of us 1 day of battery without charging
Definitely a 911
I dunno man I got the phone and the action button is kinda annoying it’s so close to the volume button I end up accidentally pressing it instead of actually changing the volume
PS L Marques Barcelona....just a big L all round.
I thought you are 23
"Apart from blurry edges on your hair (due to cinematic mode usage, I assume), the video quality is absolutely amazing for any camera, not to mention a phone. 👏"
"This is just gonna be a repeat of what been said for the pass couple years of iPhone reviews so might opt out early, cuz this is a nothing video in my book."
There is literally no difference between iPhone 5 and iPhone 15
What a 911 flex
Come on Marques…. Varca jersey? Really? 😂
Is Barcelona a sponsor?
Nice 911 ❤
You mean 15 pro and 15 pro max 7:12?
Not to ruin your action button shortcut but you do know you can swipe right on the lock screen to open the camera as well?
Congrats on the porsche!!!
Mic drop moment at the end. Whole video shot on the phone 😱😱
Does anyone know what weather app Marques uses?
Yow first thing  take off the Barcelona  shrit
Can we see the behind the scene? And your gear for shooting on iphone
Marques is a Culer <333
Nice. I'm still leaning towards a regular 15 because of the money savings and i'm not sure i'm gonna benefit from the few added features of a pro. I also want to add storage to hold my entire music library without issue and i'd benefit from putting that money towards storage.
"You could tell it wasn't the usual camera but, still outstanding quality, a regular person can have this phone and some decent lighting and get great results."
VISCA EL BARÇA
"Hey Marques! Congrats on the new ride, you deserve it! Keep it up! 🤙🏻"
How come i did not notice daammnnn
@mkdhb what’s the weather app ?
"I upgraded from 14 pro max to 15 pro max, and I can say "" no regrets !! "" I haven't been thus amazed since the 13 pro max, which was a very solid all-around iPhone . The 15 pro max feels lighter and nicer on the hand.  The battery life so far is great, and I only charge it to 80% . Lastly, the camera is the most impressive feature on the phone. I wasn't surprised when it won the best camera for the year on your channel . If you can spend those extra bucks, I highly recommend it."
The Pro Max is my daily.  I expect to stay on it for 3 years.
"ok, since u got 911, how would u deal with the front license plate?"
It's clear that Marques does a better job at marketing a product than the product owners themselves. Are you listening Apple ?
Weird flex but ok
My upgrade was from the Iphone X.  Definitely worth it for me.
Just the casual flex of having two 15 pros
"Switched to the 15 Pro Max after 10 years with Galaxy Note. I switched because I wanted a Watch for health reasons. There's lots I miss about Android and the Note, but I like the Pro Max. It's a great phone."
Visca el Barça
"Got me excited again about the iPhone 15 Pro Max, even tho i just got it a a week ago"
"Why does everyone cry ""SPOILER"" in the comments when people mention things that are in the video that you presumably watched before hitting the comments?  WATCH THE DAMN VIDEO and then go comment on it, not the other way around.  Starting to remind me of reddit with all the people who didn't read the article in the comments..."
"Jesus Christ, the most surprising shot on iPhone video ever"
"Happy Birthday and huge congrats on the new Porsche! 🎊 🎉🎊
Well deserved. Wishing you an awesome year ahead!"
"Not kidding when I thought this when I started the video, ""hmmm something's off with the video, is it the color grading or is this just slightly worse than the usual"". Testament to how even though smartphones have gone a long way, they're still far off from dslrs and dedicated video cameras"
Why is the camera photo quality sooo crappy? My pics have been coming out blurry.
I don't think Apple intends to move everything to Lightening. They only did the phones because they had to.
Switched to one from an iphone 8+. Loving it so far
I changed to Android and it was the best decision!! 😂
The focus issue is sooo annoying…
"I hate seeing MKBHD with that barca jersey!  No cap 
HALAMADRID Y NADA MAS 💪"
Just upgraded to the 15pro from my XR about a week ago and am not regretting it at all! Great phone so far and well worth the jump!!
Congrats on the beautiful 911.
"iPhones are great for non-tech people. As a tech person, I can't see myself using a phone that's limited and always lagging behind. Again, iPhone is something I would recommend for folks who just want to use social media, text, camera, are in the Apple ecosystem and don't have a budget."
"I appreciate the Porsche 911 comparison so much as a car enthusiast. I’ve only had 4 iPhones (4s, 6s, XR, and now the regular 15), and I genuinely feel like they got it right. I’ll probably use this until the phone dies or by the time the IPhone 20 or something comes out. I can only imagine how good the Pro version of the 15 is, but it’s definitely a good phone to upgrade to if you’re into iPhones.

Edit: I hope there’s an Autofocus on the new Porsche as well!"
What's your take on the apple watch news? Would love to see a video about it
Marques doesn't use siri 💀
"So the action button mimics the camera button Sansung phones have had, since at least the Galaxy S8."
Do you use a pro max or a regular
No way bro has a turbo s that’s crazy
Should have done segment on Apple Watch ban
The one thing I haven’t seen anyone mention is that the bezels are so thin that when I use the 15 Pro Max there will be times when my palms touch the edges of screen. It’s especially annoying when typing as my palms will just hit the return key or switch to the numbers mid sentence 😢
Super proud that I noticed that it’s not the camera quality we’re use to from MKBHD especially that B roll of the keyboard and the lack of background blur🤙🏼
Visca el barca🥺
I didn't except this video from iphone... But I notes lights are more compare to old video..I think you changed.. but the skin tone is nice🎉
I think the dead giveaway is the harsh lighting used in the A roll. Were you guys unable to expose correctly for that? Did you guys not have any diffusers sitting around?
"You got a 911? Wow, last I heard your opinion on the Porsche 911 was I can appreciate it, but I don't love it. Anyway, happy birthday!"
Did anyone else notice the Garuda Linux wallpaper?
"I have been using Galaxy notes (Ultra for last few years) for years since iPhone X, I was thinking about switching. Should I switch to 15 pro or 15 pro max?"
the 911 and shot on iPhone flex at the end was goat level
"your payed by apple no wonder your review is biased

EVERYONE QUIT ALLOWING THESE YOUTUBERS TO BE PAID BY APPLE AND SPREAD LIES"
"your payed by apple no wonder your review is biased

EVERYONE QUIT ALLOWING THESE YOUTUBERS TO BE PAID BY APPLE AND SPREAD LIES"
Is that a windows wallpaper on a Mac?!?!?
Boring phone. That sums it up.
"I too didn't like putting on screen protector or case, used to use my Lumia 920 the entire of it's lifetime without case. 

Nowadays with modern and more expensive smartphone, a case for me it's not really for daily protection but rather because phone nowadays are slippery, it's easy to expose them to risk of falling and in turn, damaging. Especially since I uses my phone a lot while doing chores in and out of home."
"Hell of a closer 🔥💪 
But i also thought i would hear more about battery life and new ship in daily use"
We wanna see more of the matt black Porsche😍
you can't double press the button on the side to open the camera? That's what I do on my Pixel
bruh i tried to do no case for a month with this thing and cracked the corner of the screen lol.
"I'll be patiently waiting for the 3 month 911 review. Congrats on the purchase, good taste!"
Thanks Marques!!
I am predicting this has been shot using spatial video and will be re-released in spatial video at a later date. At which point I will claim my five pounds.
"Recently upgrated from 7 plus to 15 and loved it. Also shoot and edit all my videos with it. Battery life is amazing. The only downside is that I can't add my lighting edited clips to Imovie directly, had to save to files first otherwise they just came out raw."
Sick Barca jersey bro
Marques! I had to watch the video again to appreciate how well it was shot on the 15 Pro…😜
"Really like how he invested in RED cameras 100k a pop and then people in the comments be like:  ""oh wow! it was shot really on an iphone.I would never have thought that."" hilarious.👌"
That last comment was nice!!! 😊
Using a windows wallpaper on a mac😂 5:06
"This is what I like about your videos. You tell it like it is be it good, bad, or ugly. I feel like you have the consumer always in mind and can be a trusted advisor. Keep up the great work and Happy New Year!"
I say delete the action button entirely. Not needed. Phones on mute is the only way and may as well clean up the edge.
Nice car! Congrats! 🎉
I wish apple gave type-C in AirPods 3. Still have to carry extra cable
I think this is my first time seeing Marques wear a jersey.... Anybody else ?
Me watching with my 5 year old iphone x
"As a person who's left-handed, I am happy that I finally have an advantage of being Lefty by being able to press the action button one-handed."
PLEASE DO IT ON THE BASE MODEL IPHONE 15 ALSO 😢😢😢
"Went from the 11 to the 15 pro, my only problem with it is this phone COOKS"
"That close out “shot on iPhone” was actually pretty surprising, the things we can do with a little device from our pocket. Personally I use the different focal lengths all the time to get something just right, but I can understand someone not using it and just cropping in post."
visca barca
"Whoah, i noticed the improved visual video quality, you blew me away with the reveal at the end"
😢 its too late I got 14promax I heard a lot of issues with 15pro so i end up getting 14promax as my first ever Iphone. I regret getting it instead of 15pro but maybe there would be new iphone coming. Any tips whether i swap my 14promax to 15pro? Is that the best way or just stick on this 14promax?
Lol you know you’re living in a different world when you think a 911 is boring 🥴
"I just upgraded my iPhone XS Max on Xmas day and I like the phone. My first time using phone for 5 years I learned a lot,"
Upgraded to the 15 pro max from a 12 pro max and I love it. I refuse to remap the action button because I need to keep sounds on while I’m at work and it’s on silent when I’m at home. Also congrats on the turbo s! I love those cars so much!
I just watched that studio episode. You did it lmao goated content!
MKBHD is all about Apple Stuff. 🍎
"Hammond and May would be proud of you owning a 911, collab video with drivetribe?"
What about battery life?
Congrats on the car 💪🏾
Me - an ADHD person with small hands using the 14Pro: „YOU HAVENT DROPPED IT IN THREE MONTHS?!?!?!?!“
"My action button is set to open the Tesla app. 
3:16"
DIAMOND 💎 JEWELER........... support your boy
I did not see that coming 🤣🤣😂..
Literally the first 3 months were battery complaints and here we are lol
Shot on iphone 🤯
My man made this whole video to show off his new birthday present 😂 I see you king!!!!
Team no case!
I love your reviews and i like every detail and effort u put in your videos ♥️😂 but i have to say i was surprised why the quality is a bit lower than usual then u said its shot by iphone 😢😂😂
Use liquid glass if you going rock in ceaseless
I don’t think MKBHD has ever used a case on his phone 😂
I knew this A-roll looked weird!
This is a welcomed first.
911 looks HOT!
Where can I get this wallpaper??? 0:56
Impressive as always! Cant wait for the BTS of this in The Studio! 😊
Didnt know your a barca fan..
What weather widget is that?
I realised about halfway through the video that this was shot on the Iphone there is quite a downgrade in quality if you really pay attention. But impressive nonetheless.
You lost touch with reality flexing your Porsche.
The Barcelona jersey tho 😍
WOW !!! this video was so clean ✨✨😍😍😍😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨 Great job 👏🏾
"I use the shortcut button to precondition my Tesla. Super handy, especially when I only really need to silence the phone once a day."
"I have just upgraded from an iPhone 12 and loving the upgrade. Not had it a week and I keep pressing the action button thinking it is the volume-up button. One obvious thing that puzzles me after all this time, why don't Apple give you the option to rotate multiple photos at once on the iPhone? Love the videos. Thank you"
What’s the 3D weather app you’re using?
"Wow you're 30 already! Congrats bro, cool whip!"
i have the 15 pro max sans case or screen protector and the front screen has soooo many scratches. really not sure why because i've dropped it maybe twice
Yes. So glad that Apple moved away from stainless steel sides. Incredibly tacky looking.
This video should be renamed “Flex after Flex after Flex” 🎉❤❤
What's the wallpaper used?
FC Barcelona ❤
"Cool
I was expecting some comment about the touchscreen being worse than previous models, or is it just me?"
Great Finale!!!!!
Refusing screen protectors is just idiotic
I love this guy man
What about the Vivo phone review ?
I knew something looked off about the video
"I couldn't even say the video was shot on a Phone camera, That look so awesome."
911 baby 🎉❤
Is the thumbnail an iPhone 15 Pro shot?
The 3 month review is worth so much more for me than the 2 week review. Love to see this
Nice $250k lamp you got there in the back..
"What a treat: A Porsche! Happy Birthday to you🎂💐🎁🎉
I love the longer time reviews!!"
Congrats on your new car!!!
Congrats bro you deserve it! Happy late birthday! 🎉
"Coming from an 11 Pro Max, I haven't explored/used 35% of the 15 Pro Max, which I find amazing. It's on a very refined level, where everything just work, very smoothly, very well. I feel I'm gonna stick with it for many years. Makes me feel ""money well spent"". Nice!"
0:11 I was not prepared for that jersey. Who else knows what it is
I WAS PREPARED FOR THE IPHONE VIDEO AND I DIDNT NOTICE. STOP IT RN
Without the SIM card insert you have to contact your carrier if you swap phones. How is this convenient?
The placement of the action button might not ideal ...if you're right-handed but I think is great if you're a lefty like myself. It's funny cos usually lefty are simply ignored .
the video shot on 15 Pro so good
I love ur video but why Barcelona Tshirt 😭
Haha wait are you Barcelona fan mannnnnnnnnnnn
I noticed something about was different with the video 😌
Thanks for the wonderful review of the iphone 12 pro
I’m with you on refusing to put on a screen protector on my iPhone. Something about the way they feel it’s just not the same…
Gonna need the 911 review
That barca shirt tho
What’s the 3D weather app he’s using!?
Love the Barça Jersey!
barça jersey can't go wrong with that ❤
"In your first review of iPhone 15pro, you mentioned the phone getting hot ! How about now?"
"Ain't no one gonna talk about the 911 turbo?? Dude that's sickkkkkkk with the matte black! Enjoy it.
Congratulations and happy birthday 🎂"
The surprise at the end when he acknowledges the whole video was shot on the iPhone 15 Pro was such a cool move. Great video and the 911 comparison is spot on.
FCB is Love ❤
I am on a 13 base model and will wait for the 16/16pro or just replace my battery. The USB-C is the biggest update I would actually benefit from and I would like the base model to have at LEAST USB3.0 speeds or have the pro model have ThunderBolt4/5 and the base have thunderbolt 3.
Why the barcelona team jersey
The Porsche bit was a flex 🔥
went from a completely shattered 11 to a 15 pro and i'm definitely satisfied so far
Nice new car!!❤
Happy birthday Marques! Awesome review as usual and congrats on the 911🔥
This is the most boring video u made for a while. Nothing special talking bunch of bullshyt about apple which is so boring. Ur been saying those stuff since last apple review u posted. Im done with apple stuff
My boy with the Barca Jersey 🔥🔥🔥
Ngl you got me at the end with shot on iPhone. HB. I’m still on the iPhone 12. I think I’ll upgrade tot he 14 when the 16 comes ONG
Nice flex with the 911
Did you shoot this video  on apple log?
BARCA FAN!? or JUST A FAN WEAR?! What a weird English
❤️💙
My boy lookin like Aubameyang in that jersey😂🔥
Now do the same thing for the Pixel 8 Pro (also shot entirely on P8P).
I knew instantly that this was shot on an iPhone. The image is much sharper and there's less depth between foreground and background
Stop wearing barca it suck
"wow! all iPhone shots? but my question is, apart from the talking head section did you use any gimbal to get those shots or just the iphone's internal Stabilization?"
"Hey,Barcelona!!"
"I knew something was up when I noticed this video is a bit too saturated and ""unnatural"" looking. 😅"
0:55 where did you get that weather app? I can’t find it in the App Store! 🔥🔥
Even Marques looks Barca fan ❤️
the 911!!! sweet!!! auto focus?!
Welcome to adulthood with the Porsche...
"I was expecting the shot on pixel ending, but that's ok xD"
👀
Shot on iPhone 15…. And then we all watched it twice! 😂 well played Marques.
"2023: you can shoot spatial videos now with your iPhone 15 pro!

2011: Me shooting 3D photos with my 3DS"
You know you can swipe right to get the camera too right?
The twist at the end 🙃
What was the weather app that Marques was using? Looked pretty sick.
Thank you for this video.
Fcb ❤💙
"I just got mine, I use my phone in my left hand so it’s always in reach."
Wild how marques must have spent 10's of thousands on RED cameras then when he films a while video on an iPhone no one would have noticed if he didn't point it out. I'm not an iPhone guy but they are so far ahead when it comes to video. Nothing on android comes close.
Great review as always and such a great Kit❤️Visça Barça!
i knew it
Happy birthday bro! Nice gift for yourself! 🎉 🥳
Idk but seeing marques wearing a barca kit is kinda cool!
"In my opinion, the 13Pro Year was the true sweet spot 👌"
Who noticed 6:11?❤
I really wish the side button and action button were swapped. I basically never want to hit the side button while using the phone only to lock it. But I’d love to use the action button a lot more than I do.
That car tho… who watched till the end?!
Will sadly admit that I changed the action button to camera and have used it like 5 total times 😢
What I got from this video: Apple didn’t like MKBHD saying not to upgrade every year. This is his apology video to them
Review the Porsche pleaseeeeeee!!!!
Did you use cinematic mode for the talking head portion?
ChatGPT can not do complex math.
Best part about the video is that marques is a barca fan!!!
@10:10 The Plot! The Twist!
whats that weather app at 9:08
Need a review of the new ride on Auto Focus! 🔥
"I downgraded from the 15 pro max to just a regular 15.  Wanted to save money and I gave up the idea that I really care about anything but point and shoot pictures.  

Plus I text and call people, listen to music  and barely do much else 

The standard camera works good and the usb c is nice"
Quick tip: If you want to access the camera quickly from the lock screen just slide to the left. The camera will open up even when the phone is locked
does anyone know what weather app he was using at 6:26?
It’s my dream car too!
I didn't even notice that the video was shot on 15 pro.
Good morning
Double tap this comment to like
Nice touch with that Barca Jersey! 👏👌
"I was looking at my mother’s iPhone , 15 Pro, Max, and everything about it was great except for one small feature the home button"
Darn Barcelona fan 😂
"iPhone 16 Pro will be more interesting for me. Will get the larger size since the smaller
batteries are a joke."
The last comments about the iPhone 15 pro is why I stick with Apple 😂😂 “Boring” but it’s always been stable for me.
Respect increased++ because of the Barca jersey 👌🏼
13 mini >>>
MKBHD is the only big youtuber who didnt do a review immediately after the release
"Belated Happy Birthday man :). Loving the beard mate, sharp look! And your 911 is a beaut 😍"

Iphone 9s
"Having my s22 ultra for almost two years, I'm looking for reasons to upgrade. I hoped the 15 could switch me over, but it's the same, in different wrapping. S24 looks good, but it's the same as s22, with a few improvements... I think the next step up, is a foldable, to actually feel that I purchase something ""2024-ish"".

When can we hope iphone brings a foldable? And when does the next Samsung fold arrive?"
No case always the way to go
Visca Barca Marques !! 🔥
The screen scratches way too easily
I personally find the Action button just useless and have it as a mute switch
I watched this twice
I thought he'd have 15 pro max.
iphone 15 pro by far the worst 'upgrade' ever.
Wow I enjoyed this video especially coming from someone who upgraded from the 12mini to 15 pro. Loved the Porsche reference and the plug of your new whip. You inspire me to do more with my iPhone than normal. Thank you
You know you use the 15 Pro Max cause that 15 Pro is too small for your hands
"Wtf, I was thinking at the beginning of the video like, damn MKBHD always has better videoquality than other youtubers and now you’re saying it was shot on the iphone lol"
"Man, that wallpaper is a throwback!"
"On an iPhone 8 I bought 1 year ago for a grand total of £99 from a store doing a closing down clearance, Brand new still in box, Wouldn't mind getting a newer phone but the prices are out of control."
"Okay, I’m convinced, Imma buy it right now"
Nice flex with the 911 at the end 😂 you’ve come so far man! Congrats
You have the best shirt of football ever bro
I wish…… if i could get 15….hmmmmm
OK....that fur baby was cute...
"next time, film & edit in HDR 60 fps 😈"
My Jelly 2 has a action button with better location than the iPhone haha
"I like to have an iPhone Pro or Promax to make videos, but I'm using now Galaxy s22 and still paying a monthly payment. it's too expensive to change phones each year like I recently retired."
8:10 .........he as it already lol
Free Free Palestine
Didn’t see it coming-shot on iPhone ❤
"I had to return my iPhone 15 Pro after three days due to suffering from PWM issues. The phone was giving me headaches and I was feeling a bit dizzy at times, due to the tech Apple is using to control the dimming on their OLED displays. 

Due to the above, I had to return to using an iPhone 11 (which has a LCD screen.) So much better for me and the dizzy spells and headaches have now disappeared. 

Really wish more reviewers include a PWM section in their smartphone reviews."
"I've always owned Android. This is my first iPhone. I must say USB-C was the biggest deciding factor. I am quite happy with it. I do miss some things from Android (such as notifications customization), but it really is a nice solid phone."
MKBHD being a Barca fan is the most unexpected thing ever
I can't wait to see behind the scene ...🤯🤯
why not direct to microsftsoft co-pilot app or google bard instead of chatgpt 3.5 for the button?
Sticking thumb out 👍for a ride in your Porsche 911🎂
I knew as SOON as i opened the video that this was not from the RED camera
"This was amazing. I love these ""after a while"" reviews. Also loved that it was shot on the iPhone. Crazy."
"I'm only a minute into this video and I'm predicting this was shot on an iPhone...

EDIT: Yup. The optics give it away, but still quite impressive!"
you can’t film spatial video on the regular iPhone 15. its cameras are diagonal
Hoping to see m1 max long term review
Well this iPhone is neat but I believe I've been doing the same stuff since I got myself Samsung Galaxy Note 5 eight years ago
Honestly. I was hoping to upgrade to the 15pro max but this phone has been pretty underwhelming. I think it might be time to switch to android
That Barça kit look good
no dbrand skin on it?
It’ hilarious that you don’t know you can hide the things on the Dynamic Island. To me it taken time to understand how to ignore calls without hang up on. On landscape mode 😅 so annoying (it’s not swipe up like the iPhone 13 Pro)
is the dog wearing an airpods max? 6:12
Did he just say that the Porsche 911 is boring? Bro what 😂
I salute u MKBHD for wearing FCBarcelona s jersey❤
"I'm surprised there was no mention on how awful the battery life has been on this phone, in comparison to older iphone pro's."
"Happy birthday 🎂 
Very good idea to treat yourself"
"Barcelona shirt, really?? (I'm an AC Milan fan)"
Hi Love
"You sly dog. I noticed the difference from the first moment, but got used to it pretty quick."
"I checked with my sources and had the data peer reviewed, and we came to an unassailable conclusion:
It's still an iPhone."
"I have an iPhone 15 Pro. For the money, it’s garbage. Buggy as all get out - CarPlay navigation works half the time, notifications are delayed, and show up twice constantly. The phone’s performance is subpar - App scrolling stutters, the keyboard stutters, the battery life is no better than my old iPhone 12. And the titanium? It’s stupid - Apple just fixed a problem that they created by using stainless steel. Steel is a horrible choice for a mobile device. And so is titanium. Meanwhile Samsung is creating huge phones that weigh next to nothing because they use the material that just makes sense, aluminum. I could go on. Apple software has sh*t the bed with iOS17, and I see no roadmap to improve it. Multiple releases in and this $1k phone runs worse than my old 12. I’ve had it with this garbage."
"I’m still using an iPhone 12 mini. And lamenting the death of the iPhone mini. I feel like the 15/15 Pro is still not quite a “sweet spot” for most people, but rather maybe that “sweet spot” for early adopters. There’s a lot going on with the 15 Pro that still isn’t with the 15 or doesn’t work as well with the 15, and if Apple continues their current trend on generations, most (not all) of the 15 Pro will become the 16. That is probably when I will finally upgrade. And as it stands now, it’ll probably be the non-Pro unless the 16 Pro has something really compelling to draw me in.

But I’m milking this 12 mini as long as I can, enjoying the more favorable size. People hated it for the battery life, and I think Apple is partly to blame on that problem. Other device makers are making phones this small (ahem: Asus) that are doing fine. Apple could have, easily, engineered a better mini, but they’re going to follow sales numbers, not what a minority of their users enjoy."
visca barca!!!!
Can you start your beautiful new car with the action button? :)
I'm shock that this is actually shot on iphone?!🤯🤯🤯
Only interested in that 911… looks like a 992 turbo s?
Had my 15 Pro Max for two weeks now and the most impressive things are the video recording and battery life
I would love to see a review of that beautiful 911 turbo s
"Marques, who’s your favorite F1 driver?"
Wooow! Congrats on the 911! Beautiful car!
"Not sure what car you’re driving these days but preheat for a Tesla is definitely the most useful thing I’ve found for the action button. It is hard to find, but that’s a specifically handy thing."
Upgraded from a 14 Pro max to a 15 Pro Max. I’ve upgraded every year since the iPhone X. But this year I’m planning to keep my phone for at least two years. And I’m glad I chose this year to do it because USB-C was a feature I wasn’t expecting to care so much about. But it’s nice that my AirPods Pro and Sony XM3 headphones both use USB-C to charge. I finally get the hype about one cable charging. One battery bank with one cable that can charge anything I might need throughout the day.
That means you have 2 iphone 15 Pro. 😅
I use action button to lock/unlock  the rotation. Feel free to use my idea
"happy birthday!
i got this model as my first iphone after watching your review, it's a nice phone
i'm also turning 30 soon, which got me with a bit of anxiety to say the least"
This man has the nicest facial hair
Happy Birthday 🥳 🎂 🎈
No way. No no no no no no no way! This is stupid. How the hell.
FCB🔴🔵
The question is: what happened to the worn out phones from your collection?
"Upgraded from my mini 13 that I loved. Was reluctant of the bigger size that I still wish there was a mini 15 pro option. 
But I’m surprised how much I enjoy the upgrade. Action button, screen, 120hz, and Dynamic Island make this phone a joy to use."
I do not see why buying 15 pro insted of 14 pro...
"No one would have thought this was shot on a phone if you didn't mentioned it.

So smooth, so clean."
"Guys, dont follow these youtubers who dont put cases on their phones.Remember, an iphone cost a lot for most of us. These youtubers have plenty of phones to play with. Be smart and protect your very expensive investment and put a case to protect it."
"I switched over to the iPhone 15 Pro Max from the Pixel 6 Pro, because Google has crappy customer service, compared to the Genius Bar. (Google replaced our broken phone with a broken refurbished phone.) To my dismay, the rear and selfie cameras on the new iPhone are complete garbage, in comparison to the other cameras I had on my 2-year old Pixel phone. They're so bad that my wife, who never pixel peeps like I do, has even been commenting. There's no comparison between the Google's magical software and Apple's nonsense. I'm now tempted to carry around my old Pixel for just the photos. Also Siri completely SUCKS, in comparison to the Google Assistant, because 95% of the time, Siri says she doesn't know, unlike the Google Assistant. Even though Google's customer support is terrible, their software makes it worth the risk next time I replace my phone. Having said that, the Apple Watch is waaay better than the Fitbit we replaced it with."
Matte black 992 Turbo with the blacked out wheels... Absolutely love it. Props to knowing how you use your cars and not getting a GT3 just because. The aerokit front fascia really helps differentiate it from other cars. Haven't seen a whole lot of 992 Turbos with that option.
The audio pops in this were intense
Can we just appreciate how we can appreciate how we can
It took him 10 minutes to brag about his new car. I get it. I would too.
Marques bought a Porsche??! 😮 Please shoot a full video of your new ride... 🙏
"Seems pretty cool. But apart from the 3d video thing that ypu need the apple VR headset, i did not see anything worth switching from my 2 year old samsung. Equally, the inability to sideload apps makes apple smartphones seem pointless !"
"Not sure if this was addressed some other time, but why did you go for the Pro and not the Pro Max?"
"The video quality was off and was wondering why, now I know!"
You’re the biggest Apple shill on the internet.
Can’t thank you enough for videos like this. I learn something new every time I watch one of your videos.
I’m 51 bro 😮😢
"I think they made the custom button for the recordings of those spatial recordings, since you have to hold it landscape to record and the button is in the perfect spot"
"Just got the 15 pro max for xmas and I like it so far. One thing I wish they added was multiple options for the action button ie. 1 press, 1 long press, 2 presses all can activate something different."
This guy is such an Apple sheep. He never does long term reviews for any of the Androids.
Hmm yes I need a 911 to go with my iPhone 15 pro
The exact video I was looking for
I’m going to hold out with my 13 Pro for as long as I can. This thing holds up
I’m using the 13 pro max. Brilliant still in a lot of ways. Probably wait til the 16 comes out.
"so proud we’re rooting for the same team, força barça 💙❤️"
Well done! And congrats on the 911.
"Am i bugging or is the movement and background a little strange?

Edit: Ahhh because it was shot on an iPhone, not bad"
Can you do a 911 review? 😍
Read the European law and you know when everything will turn to be USB-C
Had the video windowed and didn't think about the video quality but half way i switched to full screen and noticed some bad grain or sharpening artifacts. still mighty impressed.
I’ll probably use my action button as play/pause because when I am on my motorcycle I can’t use the touch gestures on my AirPods
Wow couldn’t tell with how overblown all the highlights were in this video that this was shot on a mobile phone😱
What weather app
Love your videos (and your T-shirt 😉)
your repping the wrong team Brownlee. HALA MADRID!!
Still can't get over the Barca jersey. Nice one.
Damn the old wallpaper was so sweet.
Still rocking an XS max. Will be upgrading next year when Apple no longer supports the new iOS on my phone.
I wonder why the iPhone 15 Pros don’t have Spatial Photos?
"One thing I disagree with is 15 being the sweetspot for upgrade. No, it’s not."
THATS THE SAME WALLPAPER THAT I HAVE BEEN USING ON MY PC FOR 3 YEARS!!!!!!! (in the fist 4 seconds of the video)
"This was a favorite review video of mine. Answering the real questions, throwing in some ""the more you know"" features. I'd love to see a couple shorter, spaced out reviews."
When I get the time. I’m going to compare the Spatial Video from my iPhone 15 pro and my 3DS and watch them on my Meta Quest 2 :)
Coolest tech youtuber ever
Amazing Porsche ;)
What weather app is that
"As a Real Madrid fan, its time to retire that Barca shirt from the videos😂"
"I have iPhone 12 Pro and on the fence to upgrade while it has trade in value. There’s really nothing wrong with it, though."
I recognize that this is not the typical video you record because there is a lot of noise surrounding the iPhone that is not filtered.
Does it show a natural titanium or a white titanium fellas?
how to flex a 911
For those wondering. That freaking cool looking weather app 9:09 is (Not Boring) Weather. Thank me later.
forca barca
MKBHB a Barca fan!!! My days bro. Let’s go catalans
What about battery life my guy!!
What weather app is that? I like the look of it
I upgraded my 12 pro to a 15 pro max and I am very happy about it!
"Rocking a 15 pro max titanium ceaseless. Loving it. Battery is awesome and lasts a few days, so nice in the hand far more balanced and easier to hold and somehow feels way smaller in the hand. 120hz is buttery smooth. And the fact it’s finally usb c means I just throw my M1 MacBook Pro charger in my bag with a single usb c cable and I can charge my phone, iPad Pro M1 and MacBook Pro M1 Pro. Finally caught up with the rest of the world. Old phone was a launch day 12 pro max and that thing was a tank, dropped it so many times ceaseless and never broke, onto concrete as a 6’2” dude. Super happy with the upgrade. Love it, oh and like the Dynamic Island too. Cameras are also a nice bump. Display brightness is fantastic. Yeah just overall a lovely 3 year upgrade, waiting that long meant that it was a worthwhile jump."
Visca Barça!🎉
"Loving the feedback! Also NOTE: Spatial video can be shot by iPhone 15 Pro/Pro Max only, not by the regular 15, I misspoke at 7:13 - Apple apparently didn't align the cameras for the regular 15."
What is that weather app or whatever it is? Looks clean!
What’s the weather app he is using?
Barca shirt💀💀💀
I look forward to the video next week when we see the fancy lighting set up for that production 😂
Looking forward for the Btc of this...
"biggest bomb :D dropped when i heard that this whole video shot on the 15 Pro, insane! :D"
CONGRATS ON THE PORSCHE!!!
"I am still confused as to which one does MKBHD use the most , an Iphone or an Android device."
"Dude that background, i had it in my lg g2 many years ago because you featured the artist"
Man we need an review on the Porsche
"Ngl, I did notice a slight difference in video quality, I thought it’s something with HDR, but I forgot about it quickly. That is great quality!"
"Loving my iPhone 15. The battery life is amazing, and the cameras are so much better that my last iPhone (regular 11), and the dynamic island is pretty handy for some apps."
"I been using for a month and this shit ass , battery dies so fast"
1993!!!
Bro said a 911 is not flashy and boring 😂😂
Culer 🤝🏾❤
"3 weeks in on the 15 pro max. Having been an android user since the samsung  s4 I must say that I miss some of the features, but at the same time I love it. Upgrading from the note 20 ultra to the 15 pro max was worth it."
What’s the name of the weather app?
What're the odds of a porche 911 review?????
I still have the 12 pro. It still feels like there is basically nothing to upgrade for unless you have a very specific niche reason.
"How is your settings app so dark? I have an iPhone 14 Pro, and it has the black background with light grey tabs/subtabs. My friend's iPhone 15 Pro has the same theme as mine, whereas yours has a charcoal black for all those elements."
"""this entire video was shot on an iphone 15 pro"" absolute cinema"
"The reason I think apple went with the same placement for action button is because majority of people hold the phone where their fingers rest/cover the sides (below the volume down button) and as a user, you wouldn't want to accidentally touch the button and get annoyed therefore placing it higher makes sense. Also a lot of people are going to use 2 hands (now a days with any phone) so placing it higher won't be an issue for lot of people."
"Mkbhd 
You made me watch the video 2 times 😂❤"
"I feel happy to have noticed there was something different about the video. Deffinely did't look like it was shot on a RED cinema camera. Maybe I noticed that because I have shot with cameras like that and know how to spot when it is used (I am a film student/DP). What gave it away for me was the artificial sharpening and the way exposure is handled, but if you told me it was shot on a sony mirrorless or something like that, I would probably beleive you. The image just doesn't look natural to me. Still, I'm impressed!!"
My bro wearing a Barca shirt. Take my like Marques 💙❤️
"Nice review, can’t wait to see the same for the pixel 8 pro!"
"I absolutely love my 15 Pro. Got back to iOS after the iPhone 7. Used a Huawei, Samsung and One Plus between the years! This phone is just wow. <3 :)"
Marques please try to find and test a few huawei products
That's a Good one! And you got me . I haven't suspected anything 😊😎
That wallpaper is almost 10 years old. If you know you know. Day 1 fan here.
So you're not gonna talk about how apple is getting sued for their apple watch? Almost like you never talk about anything negative like a paid for reviewer. Feel free not to respond to this comment
The Barcelona shirt caught me off guard
Congratulations on the dream car - you earned it.
Man just said a 911 is not flashy
Automatic like when I saw the Barça jersey ❤
MKBHD always has to throw in that he doesn’t use a case 💀
I KNEW IT! This video looked different and had a feeling you used the 15 pro to shoot it
Iphone 15 or galaxy s23?? I need an upgrade from my s21
You did not have to flex that hard on us. P911 Nice!
Barcelona 🤢
"it funny when you said thank you EU to put the usbc to iphone,, as a business they do anything for money like usbc is the good example"
The Action Button is a game changer. It’s the best way to open the camera. Accessing the camera through the Home Screen on the iPhone has always sucked and was one of the worst parts about switching to the iPhone from the Pixel. The Action Button gives a way to ensure that the camera is ready by the time the phone is out of your pocket.
"Not related to 15 pro, but Google maps in Apple car play is absolute garbage. This is coming from me who has recently moved to apple from android."
"It’s familiar, it’s boring, to show off my Porsche"
Hala Madrid
What android does he use?
That ending was master class !!! Respect🫡
The Action Button UI is the most Scott Forstall thing I've ever seen.
My 13 pro max is still solid. Battery is still great. Won’t be upgrading yet.
I actually knew that the video was shot on an iPhone before I even watched till the end.
This confirm that MESSI is the best player in the world
they should move the power button back to the top
6:12 😂
"I switched from an s6 to the 15. I had been waiting for the USB C for a long time. But after having it for just a month, i can say it was worth the wait. USB C is an unbelievable improvement. And I also enjoy the much improved screen and camera. I'm not a fan of the iOS changes in general though. Apple seems to be degradrading the iOS experience with each version rather than sticking with what works and just adding improvement where needed."
"damn it, now I gotta go back and watch the whole thing again to see how good the video looks. Well done, sir!"
HES A BARCA FAN
WHAT THE F HELL MAN?  ENTIRE VIDEO SHOT ON iPhone?????
Awesome!
I could tell it was shot on iPhone from the beginning. The over-sharpening of your facial hair was a dead giveaway.
Another Banger!
"Ha ha, yes, my boy is now a full petrol head. Also I kinda knew the video was shot on a phone, the dynamic range was limited especially with the talking head shot of you. The whites peaked hard"
"After the Apple keynote ending, I was like ""Okay, gonna be all eyes on every video"". Nevertheless, it caught me by surprise once more. Good job!"
"I’m amazed that the action button is in a separate button. I love a customizable button, but why would I give up my silence toggle for it?"
Are iphones for woke people?
The end u said it like it was dramatic but it wasn’t.
the maturity of this design [since the iPhone 12 Pro] can’t really go further beyond the 15. I’m betting the 16 pro will be a really big change in the physical body like the 8 > X.
Why Barcelone Jersey!!!!!! I did like you!
"Sorry Mk, but in a world where most people keep phones for 2 years on average. A three month review is nothing 

Now the MacBook M1 you still have is a much better reason for a long term video"
Congratulations on that beautiful 911! 🎊
5:13 you lizzo?
Where did you get the iPhone wallpaper
Was literally thinking in my head... they get a new camera? There's way more detail in the face and hands that before... lol
Happy 30th birthday. Go FCB (Messi?)!!
Porsche 911 boring?? Did I hear that right?
"I'll upgrade to iPhone 19 Pro (one with ProMotion) from 14 Pro. I'll stick to the 5 year cycle, unless some dramatic advances are made in chip efficiency etc."
"A lot of mistakes to be honest. Seems like it was shot in a rush, just so you can have a video uploaded. Too bad, it's really not like your usual quality."
What weather app is that?
"camera is decent but not breath taking.
notifications are still useless
I had to install 17.3 beta version in order to get the photos app indexing to work, as there is no easy way to debug and uninstall it.
it works nicely with airpods pro, but again sound quality is... not much different than on android."
What was the weather app? That looked cool!
"surprised there was no mention of the telephoto lens, unless i missed it?"
"Dude Barcelona pay you wear their T shirt 😂😂😂
Broke Club"
Phone of the year and the only phone worth even considering.
matte black 911...yes sir!
"Did you use the back or front camera to shot this? I can’t seem to get comfortable with using the back camera as I can’t see what’s going on. I.e. am I in frame, am I actually looking in the right place!😅😅😅"
"I'm very happy with my iPhone 15 (upgrade from the 11) except that the camera kept randomly coming on
(often unnoticed by me) and was eating my battery.
Turns out this a ""back tap"" feature.
You can turn it off with
accessibility -> touch -> back tap."
2024 is going to be epic
Haven't used a screen protector in about 10 years... Same with the wife. Never a sign of even the slightest scratch. I'm also super careful never to put anything else in my pocket that has my phone
Never again this jersey
That haircut cleaner than the iphone15 titanium finish. MKBHD probably has his barber’s family kidnapped before every haircut for insurance.
"Just bought before this video came out, cool"
"Happy belated birthday, mkbhd, and congratulations 🎊"
Visca Barca!!!
Sounds to me apple needed more publicity for slow sales. Let’s see if we see other 3month reviews of other phones.
"Wait are you using the Pro or Pro Max? 

I’ve never had a Max since I have smaller hands and didn’t like how they felt in my pocket, but I’m considering making the leap this year."
I am sorry. But how is it possible not to use a De-Esser for your mic... Please clean your microphone sound.
congrats on the 911 bruh
Still can't arrange icons alphabetically or wherever we want them to go :/
You gotta race Austin Evan’s
"My action button is contextual and I like it a lot. If not at home or if in no focus, opens camera. If at home & in work focus, turns off rotation lock, turns on wifi & Bluetooth. If in sleep mode, turns on my most commonly used alarm. If at home between the hours of 4am & 8am during the winter, turns up the heat. Just a fantastic little button"
Why Barcelona Marques why! 😭😭
Fc Barcelona sponsorship??
Unfortunately not every usb-c cable or plug works for iphone 15 series.
Marques should work at Apple! Shot on IPhone! Iconic
"Finally, someone who doesn’t have a bot comment section"
Congrats on that 911 Turbo 🎉
"Love this review format, hate the shirt... Hala Madrid!"
"At the start of the video, I noticed the difference and just knew that there was no way this video could have been shot on a RED😂... great video 🔥"
"Your matte black Porsche is incredible, congratulations & happy birthday!"
"I’ve the blue one, also naked apart from a soft film screen protector, because the screens on iPhone have been made out of chocolate since the iPhone 11. No issues at all, no chips or discolouration. 

Also, the EU USB-C thing applies to ALL portable devices, so Apple MUST update all their stuff in the next year or so."
I'm just wondering with the new Samsung 24 coming out is the iPhone relevant anymore?
is it just me or does the quality of this review not look so good compared to other MKBHD videos?
Waiting for the behind the scenes with the iPhone!
I knew it at first glance 😎
"Ohhh and congrats! The 911 turbo, amazing car 😍"
I have friends with Porches; hope you enjoy expensive trips to your local Porche dealer/repair!  :0\
What’s that weather app? I tried to look it up but didnt appear in the app store
Filmed on iPhone 15 Pro. Audio too?
@marquez Brownlee you a Barcelona fan?
Screw the iPhone..we need a auto focus with your new Porsche...😅😅 Guess he couldn't wait on the imaginary Tesla sports car
"I did the same with my action button, still sticking with the task button ATM. 

My biggest complaints are the terrible Siri, and I keep missing notification with all the modes in ios17"
"Since your video normally has a specific look to it, i was wondering what is up with it since the Iphone footage didnt hit it all the way. In my opinion, the level at what you shoot and edit at mkbhd, the iphone camera is still not good enough to uphold that standard. Even if it is close"
"Pretty impressed that this whole thing was filmed on the 15 Pro. Did you have to change up your lighting rig at all, or were you able to use the same brightness levels you'd usually use?"
Nothing like a humble flex.
You dont need to use the Touch Button on the lockscreen to get to the Camera - just swipe from right to left lol
"There's something weird the iPhone does with faces on video recordings, I can't quite tell what but it's like it zooms in or something that makes the video recordings look off. That's the only way I know this video was shot on an iPhone. Is it using another camera for the face data only somehow? Oversharpening the face?"
Uno di noi Marques love your shirt Visca Barca
Congrats on that beautiful 911 and happy belated birthday
"Porsche 911 “not flashy, not dramatic”"
Pro-Tip: Use Apple Log next time instead of that messy oversharpened standard profile.
I knew it was shot on iPhone 15 because in regular time you keep Zooming in and out. <old Subscriber from Iraq>
Whats up with the Barca shirt?!!
This is brilliant! Please do this for when the Samsung 24 Ultra comes out 🙏
YOUR  30!!!! thats wild
"Great review, but grammar nazi moment: it's ""homing"" in vs. ""honing"" in."
"4:41 i think the action button is pretty cool to have. But replacing the mute switch on the top is not a good idea for me, it should be somewhere reachable with one hand."
Oh ya?
Is the regular 15 that much different than the 15 pro? Time for me to make the switch from an 8 but still debating which model. Also congrats on the porsche!
"I bought the pixel 8, because I trusted you.
but i didn't like it, can you convince me why do you like it so much"
pulled the apple move on us with that ending
What weather app is that  the black cloud???
Happy belated birthday MKBHD! Was that that 922??I wonder then when will Apple convert everything to the USB -c in their ecosystem??
Not updating the 12 pro until the 16 ultra
Does anyone know the shortcut he uses for ChatGPT?
I love the ending.... EVERYTHING WAS SHOT WITH AN IPHONE 15 PRO WOW!!
Ayyy Marques coming through with the football shirts! That Barcelona top looks good on him
Man i wanna know more about that 911 then the phone. What spec is it? Congratz and welcome!
There is still a very audible background noise in the video. Not pleasant
Happy Birthday!!🎉   Very nice car…911 Turbo..? Anyway congratulations 🖖
Visca Barca
"MARQUEES YES! FINALLY YOU GOT A CAR THAT ISN'T ELECTRIC! ❤️❤️🔥

And you got yourself a 911 at that very well done Marquees 🌚❤️"
"Yay, mkbhd supports FCB🇪🇸"
Still using 11 pro max
My op 7 pro is begging to die now so i think ill upgrade
💙❤
Halla Madrid 🙄
That Turbo S. Dream car.
End😮
we neeeeed the bts using the iphone as the main camera on studio asap!!!
"Thanks to Europe, USB-C will also be mandatory for all accessories by 2024"
Slow down Hank Moody!
*This series never gets old. the effort they put into these is amazing. Thanks to Logan and the crew* 2:19

Worst phone 😂😂😂😂 of the year
FLEX
why turbo s and not gt3 touring tho?
The Barcelona shirt fits you well
Now when did you start following FCB now?
calls going to Apple Park a flex and then proceeds to show the matte black Porsche 911... luv it
bro I dropped my iphone 15 pro from knee height and it cracked the back. Not a big crack but still... most fragile iphone I've ever used by far
"LEWANDOWSKI shirt, nice❤"
Initially I noticed your skin color was completely off.... Until you mentioned what you used in shooting
Team No Case = IDC if I break/crack my $1k phone.
"The ""shot on iPhone 15 Pro"" says more to me than anything else. Please give us another video on that process."
Amen
The action button is placed right for a lefty 😅
Like for the 911
Congrats on the 992 Turbo S! Sick car
I'm not lying I feel the difference in your video quality is nothing much sharper than other videos which feels off to me. I change my screen settings in the middle of the video but never expect it to be shot on a good smartphone
Spanish soccer team shirt? What??? Barça! Haha! Can’t believe it! Is there any story behind it?
"Okay, this is CRAZY!"
7:18 ip15 and 15pro but not pro max and not 15plus? But the IP15 / 15plus cameras are still diagonal
What is the name of the weather app?
lol swiping to change the dynamic island graphics blew my freaking mind 🤯🤯🤯
Palestine gaza
"I’ve owned a 911 for ten years and it’s amazing how they just change it a bit each update very much Apple and Rolex which are all icons , congrats on your 992 turbo"
What's the app used for the weather he had in his hand in this video? That looks cool
"YOOOOO FUCK THE IPHONE, HE JUST GOT A PORSCHE 911 !!!!!!!"
"OMG, the entire video was recorded with an iPhone?"
"What a way to end the year lol that plot twist, awesome!"
The Porsche 911 At The End Was A Huge Plot Twist😂
"So what captured the audio? Video as crisp as all your other work, using Red Cameras may times. Transparency with audio production. ❤ 

TBA my last iPhone was 4S. Went Samsung to this day. This iPhone is the first since that teases me to come back."
"7:15 The normal 15 cannot record spatial video, because those cameras aren’t horizontally aligned with each other"
Action button is do not disturb for me so I can stop being bothered easily
L wearing a Barca jersey 🤢🤢🤮
"Nahhh thats actually sick that Iphone cameras are that good, is it me or does the camera of older iphones just get worst every year"
"Wow... everything shot from iPhone 15 Pro?
You won't need RED camera for most of the time"
"Great video, loved the insight on your use of the action button. However I was missing a section on your experience with battery life after 3 months."
"I'm really lucky that I hit the update sweetspot every time, 5s first, X second, 15 pro now. Super happy with all of them"
"Thank you!  Also, Hair looking nice! Very sharp."
Love that BARCA shirt!🤩
The phone is too damn big and needlessly have face id
The Whitewash Outside the Window and the Light sources 💀💀💀💀
I’ve had my iPhone 15 pro for a few months now as well. Still absolutely love it
No wonder why your Video Looked Less slick....
The fact that mkbhd trusts the phone enough to shoot for his main channel says a lot about the phone’s camera capability!
That barca shirt 🔥🔥
Genuinely one of the greatest YouTubers oat. Amazing video style and the sudden drop at the end of the video that the entire thing was shot on the phone he’s talking about. Amazing
"Soooooooooo, behind the scenes please!!! 😂😂"
Been a long time since we've seen a long term review by Marques. Heck not sure he ever did one before. I'm all for it.
"NGL, Bought this a few months ago and I’m really missing my S22."
"So about the quick button, shouldn't home screen flashlight and camera button also can modify?"
How dare you assume the location of my eyes? :P Great video as always!
bro just casually reveals that he got a 911 Turbo lmao
"I wish I got the black instead of the natural titanium. Battery hasn't become a massive issue for me, despite being very worried at the beginning."
Congrats on the birthday gift! Well deserved.
"Marquez, welcome to the Porsche family. It’s a sickness. It’s hard to get over."
"omg when the video starts i was like ""damn he must have some crazy camera for this quality""... wasn't expecting being shot on the iphone 15 pro"
Did you find the battery experience to be the same after 3 months?
Nice
Love that weather app but just tried to download the app and realised it cost £19.99 a year. You have money to burn 🔥 bro
"I use the Action button with orientation specific shortcuts. On the Pro Max where reachability of the Action button is way harder, I've trained myself to pick up the phone by the action button which makes the placement make sense to me."
visca el barca
More long term reviews! Long-term-review the Mini iPhones! 13 Mini FTW!
Great video!  Can't wait for the long term review on the Pixel 8 Pro and the new Oneplus 12!
@Marques Brownlee We need to see a review on the new Birthday present ! Looks insane!!!
The Shirt! How happens?
What's the backpack there?
"That's a very long intro to the 911 flex, lol"
Somebody tag Apple cause why haven’t they hired you to design their tech/features is beyond me
What's the wether app that he uses in the vid?
"Did he just say that a 911 is not flashy and is boring...? Uhh, not sure now well that metaphor works 😂"
Porsche 911 turbo s🤩
"Wish I had the money to say a Porsche 911 is “boring” and “not flashy”. Happy birthday, man. Thanks for all the entertainment this year."
"I switched to 15 Pro from a 14 Pro and I don't feel sorry for the extra money spent. I didn't expect to experience this, but the 15 Pro is much snappier and the best part is that it is noticeably lighter in the hand."
i think i've used the action button twice? lol
Iphone 11 also has main and ultrawide cameras placed horizontally but we don’t get to record for Vision Pro.
"Great 👍
Got the confidence 💪
I am ready to update my ip 13 to 15 pmx ✌️ 
Thnx for VdO mK 🤟"
Hows the battery life ?
How's the network reception?
Thank God my iphone 8 still survive until now😂
Who's here for the Barcelona Jersey?😅
The outro was dope! 💣
What is that weather app?
What wallpaper are you using?
"Why is nearly everything about a phone about the cameras? I’m more into audio, no joy for me, it seems. I’ve not taken a photo in over a year. But I listen to music everyday. Why am I left behind as an afterthought?"
"Just like many other youtubers, mkbhd turned into apple slave"
You are killing it bro with the most beautiful jersey in the world ♥️💙🤝🏻
Clean Barca jersey
Marques is a Barcelona fan 🎉 🔴🔵
very over sharpened
Shot on iPhone
"The action button is overrated af in my opinion. I use a Galaxy Z Flip 5, I just double click my power button and I'm in the camera."
Is no-one going to talk about marques wearing Barca jersey?
Visca El Barça 🔵🔴
"Yes, but how is the phone reception?"
watching this on my 3 week old iphone 15 pro black
nice flex on that 911 hahaha
My action button is set up to siri shortcut to automatically turn of all the smart lights in my room when I am ready to go to bed.
"This might be the hardest video for mkbhd,"
"Now, do a video completely on an Android of your choice"
Any idea how to get the weather widget shown in the video?
"I think something little bit off since beginning,and at the end i was like
..""Aaahh"""
"Honestly, I noticed it wasn't your usual gear for the recording coz there was this faint white noise in the background throughout the whole video which I don't usually hear in your videos. Great work though 🔥💯"
Shazam is the best thing to have for action button
"I got the action button set to Shazam. I think it’s the best one for me personally. Keeps me engaged in conversations and less and less on my phone. 

Example at dinner or wtv and we hear a song that we like, I hit the action button get the song all while screen is locked and then we continue with our conversation. It’s easy for me and thought id share this with people who possibly don’t know what to set their action button to yet:)"
Would it look much different if shot on a 13pro or 14pro?
Nice Porsche!
Looking forward to learning more about the 911 GT3.
"You mentioned usb-c first, going from steel to titanium rims. Ok. Hoorray!"
Polestar video soon?
HAPPY BIRTHDAY THAT 911 TURBO IS STUNNING!
"Hey @mkbhd, was always wondering why you are using the normal Pro and not the Pro Max for your daily use and the review videos. You got big hands. What's the reason for the Pro? Thanks!"
"Noooo homie Barcelona shirt totally get the Nike shirt, all these years watching the videos and you are a Barca fan !!! Love the videos a total inspiration"
Visca barça
"If you wanna upgrade to a higher one, perhaps you could gift me this your current phone"
SOCCER CLUB OF BARCELONA!!
How did he get the weather all to customize like that
You don’t talk about the battery and how it is not adequate . I have 15 pro Max
"Gotta customize the action button to do multiple things based on the orientation of the phone, it's game changing."
I need to know what backpack that is!
"That 911 got me by surprise! Damn! Congrats Marques! Btw, how bout a BTS of this production? Like the apple event. :D"
HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO US !
Then what was done with editing?
From the very first moment I noticed that this is filmed on iPhone. Just because of the cutout of the hair.
"Try to open that fast setting curtain on the right with always on display on and lock it, it freezes and I hate it so much"
Which weather app was that at 06:28??😮
"Corner taken quickly, Origiiiiiiiii....!!!!!!"
"Happy belated birthday!  Thank you for all the great videos you've gifted us.  Congrats on the new purchase--well earned!  Do you plan on doing track days or just more ""spirited"" driving?"
Did Marques enjoy watching football? Or just a Barca fan?
could you do one for the s23 line up...whichever model u prefer
Super camera 🕺💃
What weather app is that please 🙏🏼
"Liking the shirt 👍🏽
And the Porsche 🔥"
"@mkbhd could you say, from your perspective, that your content could thrive from video footage shot from an iPhone 15 just as well as content from your pro camera setups (RED)? I'm probably generalizing here, but this YT looked pretty solid and wouldnt have thought this came from an iPhone. I can only assume that raw video is only a small part of the quality, where the rest (and probably most) of the quakity comes from hours of clean up/scrubbing/color calibrating, etc."
"Share your BTS. 
I want to check something."
Where's the 2023 blind camera test?
Why you wearing a shirt from a corrupt club?
Congratulations on the Porsche. Well deserved
What is that weather app he is using?
"Thank you for the vid MK
 
I hope you do more of these videos. Hopefully the Pixel 8Pro next. I'm shopping for an upgrading, and will be moving from Samsung A32, which is miles worse than the Pixel 8p and iPhone 15p"
"I had this feeling from the start that if this video is shot on iphone or not; why? I dont know! maybe the depth of focus, also a bit more processed look."
This vs Pixel 8?
Did they fix the overheating?
I'm really glad that you use 30FPS videos.
"Honestly, I thought from the first second on that the video quality looked different than usual 🧐"
I am really disturbed by the Barcelona jersey. Im sorry but i cnt. You look so great in it tho no  cap but at the same time why Barcelona 😂
A barca fan?? Disappointed
"'coz your eyes are next to each other, not on top of another. LOL. always love Marques' taste of humour"
"At 2 minutes I was like this was shot on iPhone, iphone footage has come a long way"
shot on iphone? 😳😳😳😳🔥
I use my action button for my camera and using it as a shutter button. That was much more useful than I anticipated
"where can I have your wallpaper, that showed up in the very beginning of the video, please."
"Wow, I wouldn’t have figured that you shot this video on an iPhone. Happy birthday and congrats on your new ride."
Had a feeling this was shot on the iPhone 😂something just looked weird
"MKBHD: I just turned 30
Me in Kevin Hart’s voice: Damn!"
"Hi, what do you think about Google Pixel 8 / Pro against 15?"
That barca jersey ❤️‍🔥🥹
Also we NEED a bts of this video on the studio channel (or main)
I’m not digging the jersey
"I am so in love with you, what a way to end a video"
"Not the Barcelona Jersey my man, get a Real Madrid one🙂"
"Woah! My first thought when I started watching was ""damn this video is crisp"", not that your videos aren't. Belated happy birthday, congrat on the new car too, you've earned it man"
Visca Barca Visca Catalonia💙♥️
That barca shirt ❤️💙
Good lord that 911 looks sick.
Slick my dude. Properly made review. And happy belated birthday!
nice plot twist! the footage looks absolutely beautiful!
Visca Barca
ngl did not notice a difference AT ALL (also was the thumbnail shot on the iPhone as well?)
Share your shortcuts please
what is the wheater app he is using? 😲
The 15 Pro weighs more than the regular 15. Not sure why it’s marketed as a “so light” phone when the Apple website shows it being 10% heavier.
We getting a studio channel behind the scenes on this one? 🤞
Who thought Marques is a Barcelona fan way to go my brother 👏👏👏 you made my day man seeing you in that jersey!!!!!
"I upgraded to the 15 pro from a 2020 iPhone SE lol

Safe to say absolutely no regrets, it’s a beast of a phone. If you are coming from a different more recent phone, mileage may vary."
"Call me crazy but I use my action button, on regular mute, every single day"
"Only 30!? Wow. HBD! Congrats on your 911. Sad to hear that it’s boring. I guess when you drive a 0-60 2s Plaid, every other car is boring. Especially since the Plaid has zero tailpipe emissions and is not polluting the air we breathe."
So when is the 911 review??
Video was too crispy on the 15 Pro.
I’m surprised it took you so long to find out about swiping the Dynamic Island
iPhone 15 pro ❌ Real Madrid ✅
Como me gusta ver a Marques con la camiseta del Barça ❤️💙
"You should start shooting each phone reviewor at least some parts with the phone being reviewed, helps viewers to see and appreciate the video quality."
Shooting this all on an iPhone 15 pro is a flex
"What about the battery life? After 3 months of usage I think something could/can be said. ^^
I am curious if an upgrade from 11 pro is worth it (I've been using it for 3 years now and I am satisfied with it, especially with the battery. The only bummer is that I dropped it and now the glass is broken)."
6:15 for doggie!! 🐶
"I use the action button for my remote. But as mentioned in the video, muscle memory has me corner swiping. Now if I can program it for my Fire TV remote that would be helpful 😂. And yes, my AppleTV is hooked up to a fire tv 😂"
"Did not once notice that it was shot on iPhone. Nice new ride, I would have gotten a naturally aspirated flat 6. The turbo s is nice but just doesn’t sound as good or rev out enough for me. Glad you bought yourself a gift, you deserve it. Enjoy it while you can !"
Happy birthday and when are we getting… Thisssss is my Porsche review?
Can you make tips and tricks to get phones such as Samsung s23 ultra then s24 ultra and iPhone 15 Pro max for cheap in ireland specifically please
nice flex brah
"Stay away from 911's! They'll make you addicted. Believe me, I'm having these since 20 years ;)"
Wallpaper?
Because of my refusal to put screen protector 😂😂
I guess you can make money shooting videos for youtube.
Hearing you turn 30s crazy. The reality is is. I've been watching you since I've been 20. Time flies and you've been a great person to watch all these years. Thank you and MKBHD for all your videos
"1:08 Started watching this video . Seems this isnt your red camera. This looks like shot on iphone is coming....


Edit 😂😂😂😂 10:25 i said it 😂😂😂😂😂😂"
"I’ve never had a pro/pro max iPhone before, so this time I upgraded to the 15 pro max and I’m amazed at how good it is

It’s obvious that a new phone is faster than a 3 year old iPhone 12, but the speed difference is huge. 

Also the “action button” is pretty fun to mess around with. I use it to start Shortcuts and as a programmer I’ve found multiple different ways to make it very useful to me

Overall I’m very satisfied with the phone"
No more tesla for mkbhd. He turned on Elon
One thing I did when I got the iPhone 15 Pro was to use the Shortcut app to add more actions to the action button. It’s very handy!
Gee wonder if the iphone 15 Pro with all it's goodies will sell out like the Sol phone you hate so much because it's linked to crypto? Did you loose some money playing with the big boys?
which weather app is that??
Damnn youre 911 looks sick👌👌
What is that weather app? Is it avaliable in europe?
that last bomb lol
We need a video on your 911 on your auto focus channel!!!
I miss the rounded corners from the iphone 11 pro etc.
"Why does titanium have to be attached to the name, there is no aluminium or stainless steel on iPhone 15 pro"
What happened to iPhone's App dock??
He gets me with these damn plot twists endings everytime. 😂 actually mental this was shot on an Iphone
"Like everyone else is saying the comments, it is wild that this video was shot on the 15 pro. I bet not a single soul could tell it apart from any other MKBHD video if you didn’t say it at the end. Goes to show how far we’ve come with mobile cameras 😮"
I use the action button as a speed dial for my gf
"Bro just set the action button to toggle flashlight..
I mean everything else is redundant but when you NEED the flashlight you do meed to access it fast, hence the button, I have an S23U and I had my side key set up to toggle flash on long press."
we need BTS of this video on the studio channel
CONGRATS ON THE CAR must be amazing and surreal how far you've come marques
happy birthday 🎉
BARCELONA!
Great jersey
"Hello, Happy birthday to you! 
what is the weather app you are using called?"
4:07 imagine paying for a to-do list app.
Spatial videos can be viewed on the Oculus Quest. Not just Vision Pro
"""It's hard to believe. We thought you were using an Android phone. But are you using an iPhone? You must be a secret iPhone fan.""❤❤❤"
DUDE. I Felt like something was slightly different on the video but I wouldn't have guessed that this was the one shot on 15
Is this recorded on ProRes log mode ? where later u did the color grading?
@MKBHD Why do you refuse to put on a screen protector? I’ve been wanting to take my 15 pro max out of this pelican case since day one. Now…maybe I will!
Is there a channel as good as this but for phones I can actually afford?
I love 3+ month reviews. You've actually used it for real now. Maybe even 9 month would be good
Where did you get that wallpaper from?
2:44 I Like it!
The video quality of the iPhone 15 Pro is quite good but I did notice the difference
"Happy Birthday @MKBHD, long way to go. The video looks crisp & clear with perfect sharpness needed.
Congrats on matte black Porsche 911. Can't beat iPhone reputation in smartphone."
"14 pro has the horizontal cameras, wonder why you cant record spatial video on it"
"extremely disappointed how much the screen on my 15 pro max has scratched, despite not really having dropped the phone. all this talk about how much more scratch resistant the screen is, and yet it seemingly gets scratched in my pocket."
"Great video as always, Marques. I think you have convinced me to try iPhone for the first time. Also happy birthday and congratulations on the sweet Porsche 911."
"I still haven't upgraded to this lovely model, my Iphone 9 pro max just doing fine"
Does Marques not know you can swipe on the lock screen to get the camera??
"1:18 honestly, I would rather have a small permanent scratch on the screen than have permanent air bubbles and pieces of dust stuck in a screen protector."
"onset of the vid i was like ""hmm unusual lighting"" 😅"
"Awesome video, like these longer reviews. Happy birthday, and can you please show behind the scenes of this video?!"
"Crazy that MB doesn’t use a screen protector, it’s saved my phone from so many drops that could have ruined my phone and it barely affects the look of the phone."
"Man this trend I'm seeing of YouTubers using background blur in videos is annoying as fxck. Having to look at one object that's clear and In focus on a screen while everything else is blurred completely messes with my eyes. 
 Blur is great in still photos but this trend of doing it in videos is awful. It is NOT a good effect for VIDEO."
"I think I've watched enough mkbhd videos to differentiate phone and Red footage, so while i did notice from the start, some shots made me doubt."
Massive flex at the end. Jeeze. Congrats on the 911.
Amazing jersey you’ve got 💙❤
Bro Barcelona fan? How
"The highlight of this video is definitely the 911, also never realised how good matt black looks on that car"
“It is not boring” Lool okay
💙💙💙
Bro recently got a 911 Turbo S a just casually slips that in at the end 😂
Visca barca!!
"911, good choice"
I’m also on team no case. But no screen protector is damn near barbaric
Barcelona 🤔🤔
"Gahh you got me! I did notice the colors were a tad off on the dynamic range, but the B-Roll and the audio was perfect that I didn't really notice any difference at all which is insane! 

Amazing video as always and welcome to the 30 club!"
That one nerd who inspected every pixel and could tell it was shot on a iphone 15:
"Got gifted on Christmas and going from an iPhone 11 to a 15 Pro Max, it’s freaking awesome!"
911 FLEX!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
What was the weather app at the end??
You are very invited to come to Barcelona whenever you like man😊
barcelona🎉
Who also seen a cat ???
Great video….again ! And all shot on iPhone ? That is impressive man. Keep up the good work..oh…and Happy Birthday 🎬 new chapter ahead.
"I just upgraded from my iPhone 7 to the iPhone 15 pro, and I have been loving it, but I am not sure if I really needed the pro or if the normal would have been enough. 

Marques I have a suggestion, could you go back and compare the new phones to the same phone 3-5 years ago so that many of us that want to upgrade can understand what we are buying."
Wow! Congratulations!
Best at presenting videos 🙌. Forever watching
"What’s your battery health percentage? 
I have mine 15 pro max for 2 months and already 99% (lost 1% just within two months)"
Dude are you a Barcelona fan? Always Real Madrid come on!!
Why he using a wallpaper from like 2016
"iPhone 15 = 911
iPhone 15 pro = 911 Turbo 
iPhone 15 pro max = 911 GT3"
What's the deal with the Barcelona T-shirt?
Do one for the pixel 8 pro
"iPhones are objectively great cameras, great gaming phones, great music devices... But between how boring they are and how annoying some of the most basic things are (homescreen, settings, ecosystem restrictions, all that), they're absolutely unusable for me as daily drivers.

Also, the Dynamic Island is obnoxious and unnecessary in my eyes, it draws too much attention to itself and still takes a LOT of space."
You should checkout the Arc Pulse case for the 15 Pro. I have it on my Pro Max and its amazing. Its like going caseless while still being protected. Its beautiful. Its like a piece of artwork. Cant tell you how many times I've been asked about mine when using my phone.
HALA MADRID
Congrats on hitting 30yo and acquiring the Porsche Marquees :) hope to see you reach 60yo still as a content creator.
lotta white noise in this video
really pulling an apple here with the end card
Me and my mother have iPhone 8 Plus we’re considering upgrading to a 15 Pro do you think it would be worth the extra cost for the pro VS the 15 I take lots of scenery photos i’m always out hiking in the bush my mom takes lots of photos of her physical photos to make albums. What do you think?
What weather widget was that?
Can I buy this phone off you?! 😅
So you finally decide to like a different sport besides basketball and choose a 💩team. Horrible
My camera is blurry. Anyone else have this issue?
"I actually was the whole video like ""this doesn't seen like the usual quality of MKBHD"" and then like ""this take wasn't shot on iPhone"" and ""the highlights on this and the noise is certainly from a phone camera"". What really made me think about it was the main take of you, it's too overexposed. Then I just was looking in every single detail and reflection for an iPhone. Still, even though is far from the normal quality of this channel, is really impressive. If it wasn't for the main take being so sh*tty quality that I would never expect from you (and that says a lot about how good the quality normally is) I would never think about it."
"SOLD! I am getting the Porsche 911

:) one day"
Visca el Barça!! 💙❤️
"I ended up switching to the 15 Pro from the Pixel 6 Pro…in short, I’ll be going back to android after this 😬. iPhone just ain’t it."
I could tell it was shot on an iPhone. Wasn't impressed.
If phone cameras are so good why waste your money on any other camera?
Congrats my Man
"Shot on iPhone, that's really impressive. Although, I pretty much immediately reacted to it looking a bit worse than usual, especially A-roll. Couldn't put my finger on why though. But the quality is still so good.
Or if not worse, then different. Crazy it can even be used at this level though. Would be really interesting to see the same thing done with an equal Android!"
Love the shirt
Finally you dropped video about it i was waiting for you even i know everything but i love your opinion ❤ and how you describe things
Really impressed by the quality of the video.
i didnt even know there was an iphone 15 out Lmfao
Where can I get this wallpaper?
iPhone 15 doesnt do spacial video on the pros
@MKBHD So you support Barca?? You may be the only rival Madrid phones won't troll unless you praise them: LOL
"Best place to see that the quality is not on point I think in my opinion in the front shots, the hair and the light in the background do not look MKBHD level but decent this time. Respect for all the hard work all these years and nice rice. Do a drag test between the 911 and the Tesla."
"Marques bought a Porshe 911 just to understand the feeling of owning an iPhone, what a legend."
Before watching this video I just wanted to comment that it has got shit battery :p (but I might be a bit not so fair with my deduction here cuz my previous phone was 14 Pro Max and maybe I've made this mental frame of getting a very good output in terms of backup and I'm charging this like 2 times everyday!)
You don't really need the RED imo
"It’s the same goddamn phone as it was three months ago. 

That’s 10 minutes I’ll never get back."
I can't believe you didn't mention how the action button is too close to the volume buttons. The main reason why I don't switch it from Mute is because I'm constantly hitting it when trying to raise the volume or screenshot. The only reason why the mute switch could be that close before is because it was recessed. Now the AB is raised and in the way.
"Meanwhile MKBHD: I have an iPhone, it has bugs.. no problem because this is an iPhone. 😅"
What about the battery? Has it improved after the update? You have conveniently ignored the battery life.
I wonder what that robot can do 😂
Visça Barça❤️💙
I dont understand how someone can use a phone made of glass without a case. I can barely hold the things with my hands. Theyre slipper af. Cant set it down on anything without the phone sliding away lol
I upgraded to an iPhone 15 Pro Max from an iPhone XR. It’s like stepping out of a time machine.
"Bro, you look younger than your 30 😳"
Been using the 15 pro max and I really love this battery and camera. I go from 345am to 930pm and still have battery. I I would have gotten the regular pro for the size but I wanted longevity.
Not a big fan of iPhones but I'm just locked in seeing Matques on Barca shirt! Love it!! ❤ 💙
"Marques, I switched to Apple ecosystems in 2022 with a standard iPhone 13. Do you think that iPhone 15 is already a good phone to change it to? Is it worth the upgrade?"
Never even thought for a second that this was shot on the iPhone..bravo.👏🏻
"i have the pro max, the battery is crazy, i get days with 10 hours of screen on time, and 2 hours off. It’s also very light for a max, which makes using it even with a case a marvel, screen is beautiful, incredible speakers, and great fucking cameras, especially the 5 times lens is such fun to shoot with. This is a really good generation. I had heat up on me once randomly, background usage is my guess, other than that great experience"
Bro lowkey called Porsche 911 boring
Bro is using the same wallpaper since 2014😅
THAT CAR IS SO SICK!
Can we get a studio video on how this was shot. I'm still mind blown
A Barcelona jersey? Okayyyyyy
Hala madrid
you really mean every shot???? bruv!! even the ones in which you are talking... the last phone and car shot?? all of em???
"The only man to ever call a matte black 911 ""boring"" 😅"
this proves you dont need a red or pro set up camera anymore
Still using a 13 pro max and probably will continue using it for a few more years as it’s still buttery smooth. Only thing is the battery isn’t as long lasting
"Upgraded from XS, glad I did it, I purchased 2 Pro and the Pro Max, I loved the Pro because I can use it with one hand, so I gave the pro max to my brother as a gift."
PLOOOTTTT TWISTTTT!
cant wait for the autofocus video on the new 911
"This video came out hours after I got an iPhone 15 pro for myself! I’m glad the video is a positive one! I’m super impressed in the short time I’ve had with mine, so it’s good to see that the long term experience is a good one as well."
"Anyone know the Brand and Model of the Backpack at 5:54?

Oh I'm the same age as Marquess. Congrats on the 911 bud"
Wall?
"Pulled an Apple lmao 😅 “Oh btw, this whole thing shot on iPhone 15 Pro”"
"When he said it was all shot on an iPhone, I instantly rewatched the video and was mind blown."
I just caved in myself & finally upgraded from my iPhone 11 Pro Max to the iPhone 15 Pro. The performance of this phone from where I came is nothing short of phenomenal. I’m happy to see that MKBHD is using this phone as his daily driver along with his Pixel 8 which is what my wife uses as her phone daily driver upgrade from her old Samsung 10. We’re both phone cruising like Marquis minus the 911 Porsche of course. 😂
"CONGRATS ON THE 911 !!!!!!!! AND HAPPY 30TH! BEHOLD, TRUE MANHOOD HAS BEGUN AND YOU GOT A 911 WITH IT TO MATCH😂!? LIFE IS GOOD!!!😁💪🏿💪🏿💪🏿"
So wait is @mkbhd a barcelona fan
"upgraded from iphone 11 pro, sometimes i forget i have a new phone. the newest “features” are useless imo."
What weather app was that?
"Not the barca short :( 
My guy, Madrid >>>"
Barça fan? LETS GOOO!
"I’m diabetic, so I have the action button set to view my blood glucose from my CGM. Pretty useful!"
I use my action button for Shazam 😂
"just upgraded from an 11 pro to a 15 pro this week,  congrats on the 911"
Still can't believe this was shot on iPhone.
"Shot on 15 pro? Wow, it genuinely looks like the expensive camera marques normally uses."
Really did the apple move😂🎉
"i’ve had the 15 pro max 256GB, no problems! BATTERY is amazing 🤩 🤩🤩, lasts me all bloody day using it 6-7 hours screen on time. Very responsive, feels great ❤ (Upgraded from 13 pro) 13 pro battery never lasted a day 😢"
Are you Barça fan or it’s just a gift from a friend ?
I'm now praying for an true MKBHD-style review of the 911
its sooo weird wearing the same Barcelona jersey while watching this video lol
"lol multiple flex right next to each other towards the end, well done well do"
"This spatial video is gonna be massive for content creator 💙 

LMAOO"
"Was any of the footage from this shot in Spatial Mode for Apple Vision? I wonder what the support for it is going to look like for streaming purposes. That might actually make the iPhone the camera to use for lots of scenarios where you need to see a life-size representation of something, like a review."
Are you sponsored by Barcelona?
I got my 13 pro max and I don’t think I’ll change it in the next 2-3 years.
there is no way he’s 30
What happened to that Tesla? Can you speak on the build quality of the 911 compared to the TSLA :)
Are you a Barcelona fan
Global environment is trashed by too frequent product updates by manufacturers.
that reveal at the end was actually huge
"I knew right away that this was shot with a different camera. But if it wasn't for the overxposed shots, the type of camera shake, and a few bluriness once in a while, I couldn't tell it was shot with an iPhone."
iPhone > Red
Proper Flex MKBHD lol but not about the Porsche. About the video from iPhone. Wow
Love the Barca kit
"My biggest hurdle is do I pick the Pro Max or the Pro, never had the larger devices"
"Watching on the 15 pro. The only downside is the battery, it’s really lacking. Pro tip, if you use AirPods a lot, I have the action button set to switch between transparency and noise cancellation, it’s so easy and convenient"
Forca Barca!
"MKHBD


...
someone had to do it

great video, as always :)"
Was this white noise sound in the background a result of post production (sound enhancement or something) or is it a part of the original record?
"I've noticed the displays are more fragile than the 14 Pro. And certainly more fragile, as usual, than my Galaxy phones. I just don't get these weird microscratchs out of no where on Galaxy devices like I do the iPhone. Again, especially my 15 Pro Max. I've babied this phone. 0 drops, 0 pocket sharing."
"Finally another man that use iphone without a cover ;) For headset , I have from 1 month Beats Studio pro , really good as headset . I have also Beats Solo pro and airpods pro 1st gen . Why do you prefer airpods max ? It's simple curiosity"
BARSA! FULL LOVE MAN! ❤❤
This is awesome. I hope we get more longer term reviews.
"Can I ask to what happened to Apollo
He was such a great car will forever remember him"
Marques mad this video just to flex his 911.
MKBHD in a Barca jersey hmmm marketing
AND HERE I WAS THINKING THAT THE FOOTAGE LOOKS REALLY GOOD ON JUST 1080P AND IT'S SHOT ON AN IPHONE???
Whats the 3D looking weather app he uses? Does anyone know?
Weather widget?
Kudos for the Barça t-shirt! Great video as always.
"You wore a Barca shirt😌
I am liking this video
I don’t even gotta know what this video is about"
Sick Turbo!
I’ve been rocking the 15 pro with no case for 3 months too 😤
I upgraded from the 12 Pro Max and went with the 15 Pro this year and I love it!
wtf ive literally never got cuts like that on the screen of my iphones
MKBHD was born a day after I was (if we ignored the year of course)… big flex
Didn't know you are a Barcelona fan
"""911"" isn't the most flattering name for any mode of transport."
"Can you do a day in the life of mbhd? Would help to know how the phone fits your lifestyle. For example i work a dirty job in construction, my speakers get plugged with dust, i use a good case and screen protector (which i break generally a couple times a year. My work day is sometimes 18 hours. Never broken a phone yet."
"I’ve been using my iPhone SE (2016) for 8 years, I wasn’t able to save money in the past to upgrade but now I’ll be able to do that to get a new phone next year, I’m gonna have to save for the whole of 2024 to be able to purchase the iPhone 15 Pro. To which I am f’ing determined to do!"
Niceeeee Porsche
Aye visca Barca
Casually has Motorized Precision robot in the background.
‏‪10:16‬‏  that's why the video corners feels weird.. I knew somethin was wrong🧑🏾‍🦲✋🏽
Jersey=Yes.
"Ha Love the Table Tennis in the background, can't wait to see the rematch!"
Sick car bro happy belated birthday🎉
Why did you go with the smaller pro instead of pro max? I remember you always used to choose big ones because of your big hands. I also have huge hands and is the pro big enough for you? @mkbhd
I love that he replicated the Apple event with the surprise “filmed entirely on IPhone 15” at the end. Happy Birthday!!
Correction: iPhone 15 regular cannot shoot spatial video. It’s Pro exclusive.
Nice jersey!
Later reviews? MrMobile is listening 👀
Would love some bts on making this video!!!
Is it technically possible to watch spatial videos shot on iPhone on other VR headsets?
Little did you all no.. Samsung is cooking with the s24 series😂😂
7:14 Video for Vision Pro is by iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max right? Not possible from the regular 15.
"Its been 6.5 years and about time Apple finally gave us the basic feature to replace lock screen toggles for Flashlight and Camera. It still makes zero sense to be able to swipe left for camera and also hold down the toggle for camera. But now with the Action Button. being mappable to Camera too….
Ridiculous has a point and this is beyond idiotic at this point."
As a left handed user. The action button is on the exact good spot to easily press it on my 15 pro max
"7:26 ""Rotate iPhone to landscape."" should appear for ALL video recording. These portrait video recorders need to be stopped!"
Congrats MKBHD on the Turbo S.
Would have never guessed the video part being shot on the iPhone. You deserve the ride though
Definitely an awesome bit of kit. Came from an iPhone 11 to a 15PM and it was quite the upgrade. I’d say anyone rocking an iPhone 12 or above has absolutely no need to upgrade however.
That outro though… happy 30th 🎉
"Happy birthday Marques! 🎉🎉🎉 That Barça jersey, slay"
This is 14 Pro 😂
damn my phone is still on micro-usb
"I never put a case or screen protector on my phone. I also rarely drop my phone, and I use a belt holster to carry it (since phones have a tendency of just jumping out of pockets and throwing themselves on the floor I've found), so it's never gonna get scratched by things like keys for example."
Now show behind the scenes!! I don’t believe it!! /much sarc
"A 911? Fuckin A, congrats dude"
"3:07 As a left hander, this is a fantastic placement. Swiping down for the Control Center for left handed users is.... kinda out of the way. It sucks."
"Was this video filmed on an iPhone? Something looks weird (not in a good way) like textures have been over-smoothen.

Edit: reached to the end of the vid only to confirm my suspicion... Lol"
I figured it was shot on iPhone because of the blur on the video at 4:25
Mkbhd is successful
"0:02 Hey I recognise that wallpaper!
It was the default on Garuda Linux a bit ago.
My desktop still has that ""ghosts"" image as the lock screen background.
Cool seeing it here in such a different context, this is commented with Garuda Linux of course."
Its nice to see Samuel Umtiti return to F.C Barcelona to start up his own small tech review youtube channel
Porches are for people who can afford to replace it every couple of years. They are not reliable
"guys what is that weather widget? I searched for !Weather and didn't find it on the store nor on the internet, it looks so clean :("
nice reveal at the end there! I would like to know if the audio was also recorded on the iphone 15 and/or how much better would the microphones need to get in phones for you to be able to use them regularly?
Matte black Porsche is so sick 😍
I have the blue color iPhone 15 for Christmas 🎄🎁
Great video. Was hoping to hear about the battery life
Pre-ordered it upgrading from an iphone 13. It was a good decision.
Anyone know what weather app is open at 6:27
This dude is undefeated 🙏🏾
"Congrats on your 911, it look 🤩in Matte Black!, 
glad you skipped Tycan 😁, may i know which trim it is?"
"Hi 
When I tap on the top right corner of my iPhone 15 pro it makes kind of rattling sound is that normal or not"
"No comments on battery life and charging speeds after so long? 
@mkbhd"
Love ya Marques but unless the 911 is invisible then it is the definition of flashy 😜 congrats on your deserved success! Enjoy the drives
I love the F.C. Barcelona shirt. My city ❤️
Barcelona ?
Was shocked when he said it was all shot on an iPhone 15 pro 😂I need one
Barcelona Jersey! Nice touch! 😂
i finally upgrade my iphone x to iphone 15. im satisfied
Visca Barça !!
Did he just say that a 911 is boring?
Love the shirt bro💙❤️
He pulled a Scary Fast Apple party trick at the end there
Why are you wearing a barca kit noooo 😭😭😭
Happy miles on the 911.
just buy a iphone 13 pro max honestly
"seeing you wearing barcelona was the best thing on the video,and just wanna say congrates for your sis."
Congrats on the 911 purchase! Great video as always 🫡
"very nice birthday gift for yourself, keeps the motivation on top. Oh, I'd keep the beard."
Action button + Google Assistant? You're basically turning your iPhone into a sassy Jarvis 🤣. Siri ain't ready for this upgrade.
Why are wearing a Barcelona jersey please 😭😭
I just realize you are a Barca fan? Or Messi fan? 😂
My guy! The new whip is clean af!
"Congrats and Happy Birthday. The video looks cool and similar to what you'd expect from an iPhone, considering their reputation."
uh oh  Airpods Max was said
"I swore to myself to only get a new iPhone once they had Type-C. I’ve upgraded from my 13 to a 15 Pro, no regrets so far. Having USB-C is awesome just because of compatibility with USB DACs and storage devices. Also, i missed the telephoto of my iPhone 7+ i had before the 13."
The way the Porsche grabbed my attention isnt funny
How am i older than you?? :O  Happy birthday!!
"Flexes on the Vision Pro, then a cool flex on the 911. Congrats on turning 30 and the ride. Wish I was that age again 😂."
"his videos always look, for youtube at least, state of the art. I could've sworn this was shot on one of his pro-grade RED cameras. Shocked that it was the 15 pro, whoa."
Easy to not use any protection for your phone if you get constantly drowned in new devices.
garbage
"Great video! It's always interesting to hear your long-term thoughts on phones, and I especially appreciate the Porsche 911 analogy. Makes total sense.

P.S. I also turned 30 this year! High five for fellow 30-year-olds rocking Pros without cases."
Damn bombshells at the end. Whoa!
lol nice jersey
"I am using 15 PM since oct and upgrade from 13PM, The phone camera is worth to upgrade. I take lot of photos of my kid and family.. everyone say the quality of photo is so good"
I love your Barcelona jersey! Great video as always.
Barca jersey  😢 dude! Real madrid is right around the corner. And we have a black jersey even 😁
Can we get an auto focus video on your 911?
"The only problem I've had on the 15 Pro since I got it is the occasional Bluetooth dropout. I'll connect my earbuds as normal, but half the time 30-60 seconds later they'll drop & then reconnect. From what I've found the issue is on the phone, not with the earbuds, as others have reported it too."
That beard though
Barca kit 🥶
8:53 dope feature they should tell you about that 👏🏽
"I don’t know if someone said it, but you look amazing bro! Positive vibes and always interested in tech area. Keep it going! 🎉"
It's great to see you wearing Football (soccer) jersey.. it suits you...
"Great video 😁
sad to see you got an none EV car 😢"
What is that black weather thing in the background (9:10)?
Anyone facing notifications issues in iPhone?
and watched on iphone 15 pro max ❤
"the ""Action"" button is useless, it's a silent switch still for me anyways"
I had no clue the entire video was shot on the iPhone 15 pro😅.....a whole review on its own🤯
How you even you 88 days without dropping your phone? I dropped my new iPhone like around the 3rd week of having it.
FCB 🟣🔵
"Jaw Drop!!!! Shot on the iPhone 15 Pro? I was waiting for you to say you were joking.
In the wrap-up, I was just admiring, not the Porche, but the quality of your footage. How much post-production work to the footage (from 1 to 10). Very little or extra LUTs and color balancing?"
That Barça shirt!
What weather widget was that?
Rewatching because of the ending lmao
"7:14 don't you mean iphone 15 pro and pro max? because the normal iphone 15 has tilted cameras, and I would imagine it would be weird to record vidoes that are good with that."
"tldr; best feeling iPhone ever <3
i love my 15 Pro Max and it will never be in a case, apple spends billions of dollars perfecting the feel and it shows 

feels*"
"I have the iphone x, should I upgrade?"
Still no reason for a ordinary person to upgrade from iPhone 12.  Still waiting for a foldable iPhone
I actually fell out of my seat when he said the whole video was filmed on the iPhone 15.
"I honestly don’t understand why people refuse to use a screen protector and case… you’re paying so much for the phone, why not protect it"
"I may be in the minority but I don’t think iOS suits the 15pm. I have 19x10cm hands and I’ve been using the 15p for a while. This past week I tried out the 15pm for a week to see if I would like the better battery life, that 5x optical zoom, and the larger screen but I found the phone harder to be big for no to little reason. Swiping on the keyboard to text is much harder, and reachability is a must. The battery life was amazing but the pros battery life is great and charges quickly. More than anything it wasn’t how tall that the 15pm was that I didn’t like, it was the width. It’s weird but it felt more comfortable to use the s23 ultra. I believe it is because android has the back gesture from anywhere and pop out screens and the one handed mode felt better to me. It’s all preference. Rumors are that the 16p will have the 5x optical and a slightly larger screen. At that point I see no reason for the pro max."
"1. Can’t believe this was shot on iPhone…. Turned this video on and oddly noticed the detail relative to some other vids and thought, “oh… he shoots on those $40k Red cams.” Got to the end… Stunned 

2. Really appreciate the 3mo review. Do one for pixel 8 pro?

3. Smartphones have gotten boring imo. Would love to hear your thoughts on like “2024 feature/smartphone wish list”.

Thanks man and happy new year. Also Congrats on the 911"
Oh shit! Whole video shot on iPhone 15 Pro
"Good phone but i returned mine and kept the s23 ultra,i personnaly think samsung won it this year.Snapdrahon 8gen 2 is a beast  and the phone still works like day one.Hopefuflly the s24 ultra takes it further"
when is the review on the porsche?? waiting to see that on the auto focus channel
I saw drop in quality bro😭😭😭I wish someone was here when I said this looked like a phone video
Pretty impressive. Happy birthday!
What’s that clean weather app??
What weather app is that
Did not see that twist in the end coming.
Apple is going down on numbers; it's time to make a change not to help Apple but to help us first.
"screen protectors make the screen less responsive, bug out, and often feel worse than the glass of the actual screen."
"I didn’t expect much switching from the 12 pro to the 15 pro max since they’re both “pro” lineup phones but damn, I’ve fallen in love! This is the same magic I felt when switching from the 2016 MacBook Pro to the M2 MacBook Pro. Very impressed!"
I used to constantly use the right to left swipe from the Lock Screen to get to the camera fast. But now I use the dedicated button on the Lock Screen. I have flashlight on my action button.
"Damn....has a Plaid, a Rivian, and now a 911. Cybertruck next????"
Visca El Barca 🔵🔴
Happy birthday to the best tech reviewer.
What weather app is that?
What’s up with the weird hiss in the background?
Bros wearing a Barca kit💀 how’s that going
Good Shit!
what about the battery life🤔
I could tell it was a phone was a bit grainy
Had to flex the porsche at the end lol love it man!
That’s really cool that the whole video was shot on iPhone 15 pro 🤯🤯🤯
"Switched to the 15 Pro after using only Android phones. Still missing some features from the Android but love how stable the iPhone is. Also, love the camera."
"Lame video, first you’re wearing that horrible Barca jersey, then your flexing how rich you are with your 911. Nice one. Hala Madrid"
Marques flexed in every possible way but being humble ❤️‍🔥
I could clearly tell something was up with the video quality. It just wasn’t as good as one of his other videos. And I was right.
Happy 30th!
Visca Barca 🔴🔵🔴 being able to use a SSD to take advantage of ProRes is huge
"Everyone realizing the entire video was shot on the IPhone:
👁️👄👁️"
"Whaaa I didn't expect to hear that this was shot on the 15 Pro, insane!"
damn nice prsche marques😎
"@mkhbd the scratch on your screen probably came from your wallet. 

I have a the same scratch and it was definitely from the edge of the metal wallet."
Happy birthday Marques Brownlee!!
I did upgrade from the 11 Pro to the 15 Pro and I am loving it. No issues whatsoever.
titanium BatChest oh my GEEEE
9:00 you're welcome
I'm jealous he has more than one iPhone 15 Pro...
Did not expect the “shot from iPhone” drop at the end of
nice
That Porsche 🤤
Misspeak at 7:17 @mkbhd — Spatial Video is only supported on Pro Line.
I’m still on the 8 😂
Thanks. Just ordered the Max. Was on the fence.
"More long term review please, i really,really want to try an iphone especially since 14 but Apple's stubbornness to not open a store in my country make the price of them nonsensical. Right now the price of 15 pro max 256 GB is equivalent to Z Fold 5 (through authorized resellers) while S23 Ultra 512 GB is $300 cheaper. 

Btw, love the mate black 911, imho, the 992 911 GT3 is the absolute peak design for the 911, clean but the huge spoiler is super badass."
There might be phone with better camera for photos but no one can come close of iPhone video recording
Damn MKBHD is 30 now?!? Have I been following this channel that long? Man you need to start paying dividends at this point lol. But on the real I appreciate how over time you started to become an expert of the subject of each of your videos before you post now... Your vids now answer all my possible questions by the time it's finished. Solid work 💪🏾
"I´m currently 27 and I´ve been watching your videos alongside LTT since 2013? Amazing a decade has gone by. You´ve done truly a quality and passionate work over the years. That studio, that car, phones, etc. Well deserved my friend, never change. HBD Marques :))"
"Just got mine today! Can’t wait to see what you think. 

Such a huge upgrade from the 11 Pro Max, which is still a badass device."
"Happy birthday, and congratulations on the 911 😊"
MKBHD is the Goat
"Rocking Ghosts II by Justin Maller in 2023, respect."
I literally just got one yesterday
"samsung can never truly be able to beat this
It can copy but the UI isnt Smooth like apple"
My boy Marques rocks the same wallpapers on the phone which were on his computer in 2016 🫡
Any links to the wallpaper he’s using??
what's up with this weird background noise
Map the action button to ChatGPT.
The whole video was filmed on an iPhone 15 Pro 👀🤯
Pro Tip: The titanium is very minimal in the composition and not even on the outside of the rails. So that's total BS.
Who else started going back as soon as he said the video was shot in an I phone 15 pro😂
luv the FC BARCELONA KIT the best team in the world.
You got a turbo s? Can we please get an autofocus video on that?😊
"0:13 Hey! HEY! WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING?!
Hala Madrid y nada más!"
My go to is binding the action button to google translate with camera automatically enabled when you go on trips. or the smart folder when you have more than just one shortcut you need quick access to that isnt easily accessible  in the control center/home screen
hey mkbhd. I'd like to own an iPhone could you gift me one for Christmas?
The best action button shortcut I’ve found is setting up a shortcut to take a screenshot but automatically delete it without saving to your photos. The screenshot automatically copies to your clipboard and then you can paste without having to do any other actions. Seems simple but has been so nice.
"You do not need a vision pro to view the spatial videos as 3D. Apple is using MV-HVEC to encode the recoding, which has been part of the HVEC extension since 2016! You can decode MV-HVEC (using open source software or Spatialify) and save it as 3D Side-by-Side, allowing it to be viewed in any VR headset. I dislike tech YouTubers being too general in their statements, not doing research, and stating things that are not factually true. You do not ""need"" a Vision Pro to view MV-HVEC, as they can be viewed on any VR/AR headset currently on the market."
That reveal... Hoe was the editing though?
Hala Madrid
Congrats to the European Union for fixing the iPhone charging port! Thank you. Lol
"Great review.

""Carries two phones all the time""  one day you'll see the futility. One day :-)"
"Upgraded to the 15 Pro from the 11 Pro and found that it was a leapfrog update, obviously.
Overall though, the biggest thing I appreciate is the weight difference.
The 15 Pro isn't much less on paper, but it feels insane in my hands.
I considered upgrading to a 12 Mini on launch and used it for a month before returning it. I found the screen was unusably small for some tasks.
Meanwhile, this 15 Pro reminds me of the 12 Mini. It has a bigger frame, sure... but the way it feels when you move it around reminds me of the Mini.
I forget who put it out, but someone pointed out how the weight being removed from the frame of the phone is a big factor. I realized that when I take photos (The time you move the phone around the most) that you're constantly rotating the device and sometimes holding it at awkward angles.
This is where I notice the biggest difference."
"We want more of these longer reviews❤ would love to see one of the pixel 8 pro
And congrats on your new car😊"
The experience was absolutely wild🤯. Perhaps it would be interesting to discuss whether editing videos captured on an iPhone proved more challenging than those filmed on a RED camera
Obviously the right use for the action button is to map it to your smart home app of choice
MKBHD are you a Barcelona fan ??
What about Battery life ?
Need a pixel 8 long term review with all the new software features
Name of weather app used in the video please?
I went from an iPhone 11 to the 15 pro max 15. I want to love it cuz there is so much to love about it but I constantly ask myself. Why don’t I like it? Maybe cuz I small hands and that action button is so far out of reach.
Thanks for leaving the greys in <3
"Marques, you can also get to the camera by just swiping left on the Lock Screen"
is it worth it to upgrade from 13 pro max 128 to 15 pro max 256  with apple's renovation plan?
Next podcast coming in real madrid jersy✌️
didn't expect marques to be a Barca fan
"Why do people say “now I only have to carry one cable” to charge 7 different things. I’m sure you will still carry multiple cables, they just will be type C. USB-C is way over blown…"
"Plot twist at the end 😅😅😅 ALSO ENTIRE VIDEO EVERY SINGLE SHOT, WAS SHOT ON IPHONE 15 PRO 👌🏻"
I keep accidentally pressing that stupid action button thinking it’s the “Volume Up” button 😤
"Marques, the wallpaper in that first shot brought me back. I remember i got that one from one of your videos years ago, lol"
"My last iPhone was the 3G back in 2008, been using Samsung since then. Jumped from 3 years on S20 to iPhone 15 Pro 512GB, feels so good being back on Iphone."
מעתיקן
Wrong T-shirt
"Shit
Barcaa 
Big no no"
where can I buy that Mercedes Picture in the Background? Its awsome!!🤩♥️
Can somebody tell the name of the weather app?
"The turbo was the best surprise I have seen in a while. Congrats, I'm hoping to my find my way into a green manual gt3 in the future. This video looks incredible for being shot on an iphone. I would love to see some content on the process for getting it ready."
No titanium frame doesn’t look and feel any better than stainless steel
Could care less about the video. He bought a Porsche 911??
Wait for 16
"10sec into the video I was like this talking head looks weird for a mkbhd vid. Especially in the highlight then I look at the bokeh, yeah it's iPhone cinematic mode footage. If you could shoot log in cinematic mode it would be even harder to tell that this was shot on a phone."
I was wondering why the quality of this video was poorer
I hope you get pay by Apple because you deserve it. And Happy 30th birthday 🎉
"Really love the cams. However, nothing else is really new. Pretty sure we've seen majority of the other new features on Android phones before. Like the command button and to screen display, which was also swipable."
"Oh man, the turbo S is soooooo beautiful!"
Visca barca y visca catalunya🔵🔴
Finally MKB posted !
I love the barca jersey
"Marques, you need to do more of this for the top 3 at minimum man come on- galaxy s23 ultra, google pixel pro, iPhone 

Galaxy is the oldest so expecting one from you"
I upgraded from an iPhone 11.
Congrats on the 911!
Jesus I would’ve never guessed this was shot on an iPhone that’s ridiculous
"Which weather app is it ?????????
Anyone ????"
Still rocking my OP6. 😁
"Best phone out at the moment, until the 16 Pro ;)"
"wow, that's some impressive vid from the iphone. Congrats Marques on that sweet ride 💯"
@mkbhd congrats on the 911 Turbo S 🎉
"I turned my shortcut into the flashlight, it's pretty useful and I use it more than I thought I would"
I use the action button to open the apple TV remote app. I can never find that tiny remote in my living room.
You use WAY 2 fancy cameras for it not to be obvious that that was shot on the iPhone.
"Congrats on 911 bro, it's a dream car"
im more interested in Marquess' Barca shirt!
Marques please do a video on the 911!!! Congrats!
Please do a long term review of the p8p
"15pmax here, how come my videos look crap 😭"
Barca!!! 🤦🏻🤦🏻
You should include a comprehensive resource and labor acquisition analysis on the creation of the phone as part of your review
I really hope to se review on the pixel as well after some time
"I went for the 15 pro max. I wanted the extra battery and damn, the 5x is goooood. My only complain is that now the 3x is only digital zoom, but I can live with that"
I'm stuck with iphone 7 plus 😂
I bought myself a bag of Doritos for my 30th birthday so MKBHD and me are the same basically
I actually use my action button all the time. I have it mapped to a short cut that opens different apps depending on my location. Also congrats on the 911 turbo 😍
Did you hear that it's titanium? You should know that it's titanium. Titanium.
"What is that weather App? 
Shot on iphone? This is crazy!"
I needed this
"9:47

I love you and everything you do but an understated and subtle  car would
Be a  Mazda 3 or Toyota Camry.

A NEW Matte black Porsche 911 Turbo S is NOT subtle.   That is a supercar my man.    You deserve it though!  Congratulations and DRIVE SAFE 

Not to mention you have a 10500$ custom wheel option  on top of your custom paint job option.

2021 992 Turbo S Coupe with those add ons that I can see.   I would estimate 260000$ USD.    AKA  a house.    

Not trying to disagree because I get it.   Most (non car) people can’t tell the difference between and AMG and a regular Mercedes  or tell the difference between and Audi RS5 and and audi A4.   Certain cars are meant to be subtle and always luxurious.  (Even BMW especially)   It’s hard to tell which one is the super car because they look very very similar all around"
My 15 Pro Max has a screen protector. First time in a few years that I’ve had one in. But I’m also not using a case so
What is that 3d looking weather app?
Happy Birthday MKBULTRAHD
"I could tell this wasn't shot on the RED, but its damn impressive either way."
The video quality is on a different level.
Unreal this was shot on an iPhone
"Ouch, do you just throw your keys into the same pocket as your phone? That scratch! I've had my 12 Pro since launch and never used a screen protector in my life, and have no scratches like that."
"I did notice the slightly worse video quality compared to your usual standard, but it's still very very good. Apple is still way ahead of everyone when it comes to video."
Nice tshirt marques
Marques filmed the a role on dec 22 at 11 30 and the b roll at 2 pm cool to know
Barca jersey 👌🏼
"In the interview shot of Marques, you can see that the background blur was added in post video processing/ editing- because you can see that marques hair edges are not exactly blurred, and sometimes the blur comes on the hair ends. 
But overall very nicely done. I could not realize this until he mentioned shot on iPhone at the end"
I hope there's a bts of this on the studio channel
I love the beard
One iPhone One Mac and you are a Pro Videographer
I love my s23 ultra but will say it’s a joy to use the 15 pro I have a pitaka case on mine and it’s so sleek .
I have a 12 pro . Is it worth upgrading to 15 pro? Or should I just wait til the 16 pro comes out?
commenting only because i can't afford to buy one😂 damn poverty
"Hi, does anyone know what weather widget that is on 9:05-9:11? thanks!"
Se me cayó un ídolo. Hala Madrid!
Congrats on the 911! Such a great car.
"My man just made the apt choice regarding football, or as u may say, soccer."
why bro got a barcelona jersey on 😷🤢
would've thought that marques would daily the pro max not the pro
"Lol immediately I was wondering ""did Marques get an external editor in? What's wrong with the exposure and colour? Did they have to rush this video out?""


Then I found out.
Shot on iPhone 😂😂😂"
Barca jerseyyy😁😁
BTS is definitely needed 😁
Wallpaper?
Remind me why we own thousands of dollars in cameras instead of phones? Maybe @whistlindiesel is on to something...
Lol Barcelona
i like phones
"If it's not too much to ask, can you please tell us what your camera/shooting settings were on the iPhone 15 Pro? 🙏"
Messi 😎
I went to rewatch the video right the moment you said shot on an iPhone. That is crazy. Will check 4K on my 4K monitor later. 😮😅
🥱
"Breaking News!!!
Marques is going to Barcelona 😂"
"In order to reach the camera even faster, you can also swipe to the left from the lock screen instead of long pressing the camera."
VISCA BARCAAAAA 💙❤
we're not talking about the barcelona jerseyy???
"Any comment on the battery life? I'm loving my 15 Pro Max, changed my 12 pro that already had a battery replacement - but frequently needed a 2nd charge during the afternoon. With the 15, using it about the same as the 12, if not more, usually I still have about 70% juice at the end of the day!!!"
Barcelona fan?
"I personally use the action button to set auto rotate on and off. I think it's great, when i'm watching a video in bed and need to change the other way aha"
I don't know if his using the jersey because of Barça or due to the fact that it was the special edition released with Drake's symbols but I'm always charmed when I press on a MKBHD video and his wearing his FC Barcelona jersey😍😍😍🔵🔴
Need a BTS of shooting this on the 15 Pro like Apple did lol
"I really didn't expect this video to be......


shot on iPhone
edited on Mac"
Barca 🔵🔴
Great. Love that a 911 is understated and kinda boring.
Loving the Barça Jersey!
They never show the usbc in the commercials and that's the most significant change. Just talk about titanium like anyone cares.
people are surprised the video is filmed on an iphone like are u blind? when u take pictures with your phone do close your eyes and not look at the quality?
"I can’t believe I’m saying this, but the video that was shot on this smart phone looked sharper and clearer, but otherwise exactly the same, as your pro camera, that you normally used to shoot your videos. And SOOOO much better than that video that you shot on the pixel 8 Pro. You seriously should switch to an iPhone to shoot your videos from now on."
That's a clean 911
Happy birthday)
Man you are not only a great reviewer but you happen to follow the best football team. Thanks for video. Visca el Barça!
The whole video was shot on iPhone 15 pro *S**t. First Apple Event and you too. Happy Birthday to Tech Expert or I should say Tech Nard. Wishing you a Happy new year in advance.
action button was built for left handed users :)
30 years old that's when the back pain start
"""Also, this entire video, every single shot..."" Oh, no, not again ""was shot on an iPhone 15 Pro"" here we again!!! You'd think I would notice it the second time."
what's that weather app icon? looks cool.
Bro. the Backpack!!
Oo an iphone ad.
"Probably missed the info somewhere but what decided you to go with the regular rather than the pro max ? The size for double phone carry ? 
Also : no more Tesla ??"
Happy birthday !!
The madman did it. He said that he'd shoot a video on the iPhone and won't let us know until the end.
Anyone else also found out this was shot on iphone while watching or was it only me?
anyone know what that weather app is?
"I saw the Porsche app on your phone, I knew you gifted yourself something good."
I'm going to map my action button to the camera. I like that you can set the default camera then take a photo with the action button.
"Happy Birthday Marques, is that a turbo S or a 991 gt3?"
Barca!
Nice Garuda Ghosts wallpaper!
Yeah you can clearly tell this was recorded on an iPhone. The quality isn’t as good as your other videos
"The iphone with the most issues. 
Overheating, battery drain, camera crashes. Etc"
ViscaBarça ❤💙
So you hate ronaldo
I was shocked by hearing the sentense from marcus is..the whole video shot is taken by another iphone 15 pro
"Most overrated phone of the year smh
And not because of the phone itself  it's great
But IOS is so subpar smh imagine an I15PMAX with One UI or at least HALF of the features smh"
you fit in that car lol
Message back from the Netherlands (europe): you’re welcome
Why not the pro max?
That smile at 6:15 makes me think you do know about potential Airpods Max 2 👀😂
Excited for the Porsche 911: 3 Months Later! video
The way my jaw dropped when you said the entire video was recorded on an iPhone...
"13 PM was the M1, dnt see myself needing more so i'll keep my 13."
"Couldn't be happier with my 15 Pro Max, I was coming from a regular iPhone 11."
"Marques looking sharp with the facial hair, good look bro :)"
"These longer reviews are always nice to see, it actually gives an assessment of how the phones been doing over time rather then just when it launches"
Do you use any of the built-in iPhone camera filters?
"I don’t know it’s with me or other also facing it. But iOS now a days sucks. Like from Insta to PUBG everywhere it lacks & battery life also. Some updates are good but some are just trash. 
iOS is not consistently good like it used to be."
This was all filmed on the iPhone? Tim Apple will love that.
"After having my 15 Pro for about 2 months, and it’s been alright. The battery life hasn’t been as good as my old 13 Pro. The action button I often forget is there, and I still have it as a mute button. The DI is neat, but I hate that it’s at the top of the screen, so thus I rarely actually interact with it though its animations are nice. USB C has been nice, after getting the new USB C AirPods Pro, I’m finally rid of lightning. I also don’t use the always on display, as I have an Apple Watch 7 with it so i don’t need it on my phone either. Overall it’s a good phone. It isn’t worth the upgrade from a 14 or 13. But I think a 12 or older, it’s a good upgrade."
Great review. I jumped from my 11 to this 15. See you at 20!
The iPhone 20 will have an AI robot that pops out and gives massages. Then she pops back in.
When can we expect Google pixel 8 pro review?
As person who has owned the iphone 15 pro max since its release i have used the action button everyday for flash
"Cuts ARENT normal ffs. Just how does one manage to get such big cuts in only 88 days? I have my 12 Max Pro for 3 years and i abuse it on the job and never use screen protectors, but i only have 1 small cut on it from dropping it on pable. How do you manage to abuse it stonger then that in such short time while not actually doing an physical job, where the phone risks to fall down or be pressed on hard and sharp surfaces???"
"The battery is shit tho, and the heating issue."
"Nice Garuda Linux background

Also, Happy Birthday. Welcome to your 30s~"
Marques is cule 💙❤️
to the future 😂
Is anyone gonna talk about that plot twist😮😮😮😮 it was all shot on iPhone I had no idea!!!
"AMS49K is a scam guys, these bots are shady af"
"I can’t watch this video with that Barca jersey you have one, Hala Madrid forever"
@stradman
"Sounds like a paid advertisement by Apple to boost their sales. Haha. Cellphone era is dead for now. Why even bother investing $1,000 in old tech. Lets be real here. There is nothing new about it."
The video is almost perfect in every way. Objective facts. Only problem is the Barcelona jersey. MKBHD please do yourself a favour and change it
Me who is watching the video in 360p: nice i didn't see a difference being it shot on iPhone 15 👍💀
"You look a little tired Marques, you good?"
"You CAN watch spatial video now, virtual reality oasis has a video on watching iPhone spatial video on a meta quest 3 2 or pro"
I just got my iPhone 15 pro and it’s amzing
I’m thinking for upgrading from 12 should I just keep it for another year or get the 15 nice Barcelona jersey btw marques
HALA MADRID
New channel coming of marquees garage 👀
"3:21 , the ""My Porsche"" app is a bombastic flex"
"I programmed the action button to simultaneously open my Tesla's charge port and frunk. This way, I can easily retrieve my charging cable from the frunk and connect it with just one button press. Additionally, the button halts charging and opens the frunk when the car is being charged"
"I remember that wallpaper! You had it a looong time ago on a desktop as a background, i was still in middle school then and i used it also on my laptop. Man time flies…"
I didn't see the Barcelona Football T-Shirt coming on this channel :)
I could tell this wasn't the usual MKBHD camera  but it's not bad as well. How impressive  that phone tech has gone this far
1 minute 3 seconds in I said 'this is shot on iPhone'.  I can't believe people had to wait until the end to see this.  It either says something about tech followers inability to pay attention to years of tech reviews and details or it says that you don't need to spend tens of thousands on cameras and lenses if the content is what draws people in.  Either way.  Great video. The first two years of my business was shot on iPhone XS then 11 Pro. Lee
2023 Flagship phone❤
I think you mean spatial video on 15 pro and 15 pro max. Because you can’t record spatial video on the 15
I love technology always. I make it for god.
2:32 exactly!!! It's the only (I think) three dimentional User Interface in the entire settings app😶
Damnnnnnn 🔥🔥🔥
"Happy Birthday Marques, congrats on the 911!"
can anyone link me his wallpaper?
"Turning 39 next week, can't believe I'm saying that out loud either, for a short time me and Marques will both be in our 30s and he's still a little kid in my eyes. Time flies."
I have iPhone 15 pro and no issue at all even battery 😊
Happy Birthday 🎉 and congrats on the sick whip🔥
Barcelona shirt love it
"Correction, you can only record spatial video on the Pro and Pro max since the iPhone 15 has the diagonal camera arrangement and they will probably have this feature on the vanilla next year"
It does not have a sim slot...so 13 pro max all the way
my guy Marques going for that Apple sponsorship 😁
"As soon as the video started, I noticed something different and thought: “He’s using a different camera in this video!” But didn’t expect to be the iPhone itself. Great quality though, still not on par with real cameras with proper lenses but perfect for content creators having some high quality and consistent footages."
So it's crap 😂
"You don’t need an Apple Vision Pro to view spatial videos. You can view them on other VR headsets, like the Quest"
Barca funs  ❤❤❤
"Interesting that APMs are your travel headphones of choice since they’re pretty objectively the worst amongst competitors (XM4/5s, Bose QC & 700s, B&W PX80s) for traveling in my experience"
wow. when you and the guys decided to shoot a video on for the channel with an iphone. i didnt think it will be this soon. big ups❤❤
4:25 Garuda wallpaper 🤔
Fresh jersey
Barca means 🌈🌈
where did this man get a fucking 911
Congratulations 18M sub
Happy Belated birthday . Wish you success in all you do.
Barca!
I wonder if Marques can even put in words his excitement for the Apple Vision Pro. Over 15 years of Youtube Tech & this seems to be an insane device. Getting one for sure!!!
"Iphone 15 Pro after a month of use, and I am delighted, its cameras are the best, its video is beastly, its power is absurd, etc... Definitely a very good purchase for those who want a high-end phone for playing, working, photography, whatever, this powerful little one will work for you."
Can you share the wallpaper please?
"As a 15 pro max user, I ended up switching the action button to the flashlight, because it is too high for things like opening camera. I use it maybe once every few days"
WOOO porsche gang!!
"thank you for mentioning the scratches on the front glass. ""ceramic shield"" is an absolute scam on an otherwise excellent phone. apple needs to pick up their glass game, especially since their phones are mostly made of the stuff!"
15 Pro is a gem and my first Pro iPhone. Am very happy with this phone and the battery life is outstanding. Apple for the win 👏🏽Congrats on your success. That Porsche is a HUGE flex
I configured my action button to open the Shortcuts App and have two very important shortcuts right at my fingertips: turn on/off the always on display and turn on/off mono audio. Talk about time saving! Yay!
Can we see 👀 a video with your Porsche911 ?????
Hows the battery?
was the audio also captured with the iphone 15pro?
Easter Egg at 6:12 😊
if you are subscribed to chatgpt+ you can ask it to do things in real time - like get the weather or a stock price
it's a great phone
Damn I remember using that wallpaper you’re using in your iPhone probably around 10 years ago in my 5s 😂
My favorite usage of the action button is setting a shortcut folder and getting a menu of shortcuts to choose from
Thank you Europe 😂😂😂
I don't want to hype things up but I hope Marques reviews the new Moto G's coming up for 2024. I'd say it was a good contender for Most Improved for 2023
"Lmao the action button is hilarious. This is my first Iphone, always had galaxy and it’s so annoying how double pressing the power doesn’t open the camera like it always has on android. Or how you can’t double tap the action button for a second function. Iphones are hilariously frustrating to switch to."
Isn’t it easier and maybe even faster to just swipe to get the camera opened up on the phone?
"Special video is available only for 15pro and promax, not 15 as you mentioned 7:18"
"every single shot? wow.
did you use a seperate mic. to record audio or that too was recorded with this iphone?"
FC Barcelona🤩 💙
Bro casually showed us Darth Vader’s 911
"I will change my 14 Pro with 20 Pro when it will come out, hopefully it will have more improvements <3"
Love the throwback wallpaper
HALA MADRID ! 😂😜
Great apple commercial 😂
Visca Barca!
Looking great in that Barça Shirt! You’re the G
"My iPhone 15 pro still heats up like crazy from time to time. Almost always when charging, and randomly on video playback/geolocation heavy services"
i have flashlight on my action button and i love it. just hit the button in the dark and i got a bright light
😂Marques just made this  video just to announce that he bought at 911😂🤣😂
"I can’t lie everyone hating on the iPhone for its “same design” people don’t understand how the tech era has changed…even Samsung has started to dwindle on design updates, people really need to take a step back and actually understand what is happening with tech nowadays, especially the ones who have no idea what is going on lol"
Amazing work from you the best Tech channel in the world the number one .
"The action button reminds me of the Bixby button on the S9+ that I had. With bxActions that was a super useful feature that I do kinda miss on the Pixel 8 Pro. I wish more phones had one, I wouldn't mind if manufactures copy this from Apple"
Noticed the lens blur and the colors are not the usual but it's really impressive
Went from an iPhone 11 Pro to a 15 Pro. Don't regret it at all. HUGE upgrade. I think it's the 120hz display I appreciate the most. My OLED TV is 120hz and now I can never go back to a 60hz phone.
Ik it in the beginning of the video because every time I watch all the video the colours are different and in this video I noticed it from the starting wondering what’s wrong with my eyes ?
That wallpaper tho. 🤩 Been using it since ages!! I remember putting that wallpaper on my Nexus 5 after I saw it on one of your videos ❤️
I love your Barcelona jersey ! 😍
Loved this vid. Please do the same for Pixel 8/Pro 🙏🏻❤️
No mention of the terrible battery
"7:14 you can actually only record spatial video on the iPhone 15 Pro’s, not on the iPhone 15’s"
I want the 15 but I’m not really tech savvy so I I feel half of the stuff I probably won’t use
"Currently using a 13 Pro, thoughts on upgrading to the 15 Pro Max? I’m not satisfied with the camera quality on the 13 … much of a difference or better to wait for the 16?"
"Hello, Marques! Why aren’t you using the Max one given you have a large hands?"
"Wow that was shot on the iPhone. I would be able to tell, just sell your expensive cam gear."
Barcelonnnnaaaaaa🎉🎉🎉?????? I’m so happy lol
Hala Madrid
Mind blown when you revealed that every shot was off an iPhone!
"Congratz on the 911 dude.
Have been my favorite car for last 4 years"
"Happy birthday man! I like the follow up review video, great call."
Doggo cameo at 6:14. You're welcome
iPhone 15 (non pro) after 3 months?
Ghosts 2 wallpaper supremacy
"Are you ready for battery replacement in any phone în 2025 ??
Also thank you Europe 🇪🇺 🙏"
I still have my OnePlus 6T. Has everything i need and everything i dont need. Could record 4k 60fps (rarely use it). Just wish it had a slight better camera for photos.
I'd rather donate such amounts of money to help Palestinians than spend it on buying a phone that's been the same since the 11 series. Garbage
NICE 911 MARQUES!!!!!! you GOTTA tell us more on wvfrm!!!!!!!!
"Wish you would’ve at least mentioned the big pile of problems this phone and iOS currently has. 
I would say all the problems alone makes this one of the bad years to upgrade."
so he made a whole video to tell that he just turned 30 and bought matte black porshe
"Marques, in case you missed it, the Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2 are now available for sale again. The issues with the lawsuit must have been resolved."
You said nothing about battery life.
"The Dynamic Island tip, thanks dude! 👌"
"Dude, I am so excited for you about the 911. That thing is absolutely sick."
I was at 05:20 mark and I thought that wait! This was shot on iPhone. And I was right :)
Thank you Europe 🇪🇺
All shots taken by the iPhone 😱👏🏻
Really Samsung need to do something special in video recording department to catch apple 😮
Love the usb c move
"The one thing they need to fix with ChatGPT is to stop snitching on itself🚶🏽🚶🏽🚶🏽.

Get a new Jersey 😢 It's Old
Barca💙❤
what's that weather app you're using? :o
"My favorite number is 4 and my second favorite number is 6.

That being said, I'm waiting for the iPhone 16. cause it has my favorite number 🌻🐽🌅"
Any link for that Home Screen wallpaper pls
nice tshirt❤️💙❤️💙
"I must have missed something but, I thought Marques likes big phones? Is there a reason he's daily driving the regular pro instead of the pro max?"
"I threw up in my mouth a little when you said ""true smartphone photographer"" like that's a thing people put weight behind"
I wish I was ballin like marques and could go caseless all the time. It’s so much better. I do it around the house and love it so much then when I leave the house I walk around like a poor with a case on it because I can’t afford to break it.
Wow! 18M Subscribers! Congrats 🎉🎉
Happy birthday 🎉🙏🏿
Not in total agreement about the action button being “too far to reach”. Not really that bad.
Happy birthday and congrats on the Porsche!
its funny you mention about the positioning of the action button because since im left handed al the buttons seem to be in the perfect spot for how i hold the phone. i never thought about how it feels for someone who isnt a lefty
you should put a magic john screen protector on your iphone
"I use the action button quite a lot, I have it set as a light switch for my bedroom"
Sincerely thought this video was a Zoom call. Not a great show for the iPhone 15 Pro.
Just here for the Barca jersey!
I like my 15PM. It’s my second iPhone ever. Upgraded from 12PM. The handful of people that don’t care about what phone you have people like the phone. My Android friends absolutely shit all over my phone and give me crap every day. I work in I.T. so I don’t understand the hatefulness towards a phone. I also got 1k back from my old phone.
that shot on iphone bit had me way more surprised than apples im ngl
"The iPhone to 911 analogy is a perfect one. Not many things have essentially remained the same for over 50 years. Of course rumors of a more substantial iPhone redesign seem to resurface every generation but if not next year, it's hard to see Apple maintaining pretty much the same design for too much longer. Design is much less of a phone purchase decision maker than it once used to be and longtime iPhone users don't continue to buy an iPhone because they like the design, most anyway. We held out on a phone upgrade for my wife's 12 Pro till this 15 Pro came out and I'm glad I had her wait. The 15 Pro in Natural Titanium is easily the best looking iPhone for me in a long time."
To be honest I actually noticed it was shot on an iPhone - after a few minutes with a shot of Marques talking to the camera… but I am a vfx artist so that might have helped me to recognize it
I was looking for this video yesterday 😂😂
Even the shots when you're filming the iphone 15 have been shots on an iphone 15 ?
"Who remembers when Marques said he would shoot a whole video on the Waveform podcast??

HEY GREAT VID YALL!!"
Wow a customisable button!  Newest features in 2023...please tell me how did they reinvent this attribute when it's old as hell
DAMN bro really hit us with a bombshell at the end I’m genuinely impressed
Any flagship smartphone under the same lighting condition would produce the same video camera quality output
Visca Barca
"I had a feeling that it was shot on an 15 pro, as soon as you zoomed in on you once. Not sure why though. It just looked liked it."
"Eew, nothing about battery life..
I can't believe people are going to buy or fall for Apples Vision thing for $4k. 
Apple is like Disney, for kids & easy to operate. 
It'll take you years to learn the feature packed Samsung phones or Android phones in particular"
"HOW do you people scratch your phonescreens like that lol??? 
Had my 14 Pro Max for over a year now, NOT a scratch on it lol .. ? No screen protector at all .."
How on earth can you record the screen of the phone with another phone and have it look so good?? Is it magic?
"Feels too close shot 

Edit 
Oh now i get it"
one thing which made me very regret is that to me iPhone 15 pro max didn't really provide me any changes I need by upgrade from iPhone 13 Pro Max. And the battery life actually worse than 13 pro max
The weird exposure flickering/control on indoor and outdoor shots really gave it away that the video was shot on tiny mobile optics. I noticed the same issue on your Cybertruck video as well.
Great video and an awesome car. Congrats🎉
only 13 seconds and I already gotta give you a thumbs up for the Barca jersey! Visca Barca
"“…just turned 30….”

ಠ_ಠ 

Damn kids, making tech videos on my lawn!"
Congrats on the 911 Marques! So happy for you!
"Congrats on the new car, fantastic video."
"From the beginning of your video, I consistently found myself pondering why the video quality isn't up to its usual standard today. 😅😅"
"6:28 the weather app is called ""Not boring"" It's paid tho."
Happy Birthday Marques! Porsche really suits ya
here come the apple bots forging their fake ass positive reviews
"Can you make a long review of Iphone 15 plus also if you did use it that long? 
I ended with getting 15 plus instead of max due to reviews on youtube. Until this day i am still not sure if i should have got pro max."
Made a jump from 6s to a 12 at the beginning of the year.  Like going for a compact to a Maserati.   I look forward to the next hardware upgrade for me.   Hope it’s feels similar to my most recent jump
congrats on the 911
"""Porsche 911""

""It's boring, it's familiar""

💀💀💀"
"Not the turbo 😭 yes i know it smokes the living out of you, but naturally aspirated engine is sooo much better sounding"
15 Pro is the best phone on the market. 2nd is Pixel 8 Pro.  nothing else matters.  PS: the worse feature ever created on ANY smartphone is Apples version of the App Library.  Just do it the way google pixel does it.
Does anyone know what that weather app in this video is???
i'm soo happy the best tech reviewer is for the best club. man of culture. visca barca
The FCB jersey ❤️❤️
Hala Madrid ❤
"Knew something was off with the video, not saying it's bad but rather felt different from the typical MKBHD video."
When do we get the GT3 RS equivalent of the iPhone?
"Didn't last long ??
Why are you treating the action button like a relationship 😂😂😂😂😂"
"Always intuitive show, and congrats to the new ride :-)"
"In the middle of the video, i just said to my wife: ""This was shot on iPhone"", but I'm still surprised it took me so long 😅"
What games were those?
"W CAR. W Channel.
One of the very few unbiased reviewers out there. I like how you appreciate apple without sounding like an isheep and yet prefer android overall."
w jersey
Happy late birthday 🎂
10:11 there is no way that the whole vid was shot on an iphone !!!!
Congrats on the 911 Marques! Awesome machine! Please make some video on the Auto Focus for us!
This guy is really rich. Damn
"Yoooo, what about the battery life??? 😢😢😢😢"
"We see your Porsche app Marques, you found the 911 to be your daily driver right 🕵️🏼‍♂️

Edit: I didn't watch all the way through yet"
"00:00 Long-term usage reveals more about a phone's performance and features.
00:39 Using a phone without a case can lead to wear and tear.
01:39 The multiple focal lengths feature of the camera is not frequently used.
02:26 The customizable action button has practical uses.
04:53 USB Type-C offers faster speeds, but not all devices have transitioned to it.
06:19 Software updates have brought new features and improvements.
09:08 The iPhone 15 Pro is a worthwhile upgrade for users with older iPhones."
"When you know Marques too well that from the first shot you notice he used a different camera, see the soft bokeh and think ""That's an iPhone video"" and connect the dots... (and secretly pixel peeping every shot to find a frame with a reflective object to prove it's shot on the iPhone...)
Oh and in 6:31 - nice 😏🔋"
Been loving my 15 pro as well! Congrats on the 911 as well!
So you got your self present 911    Turbo 😅😅😅
I thought you'd say that other plunge you took an oath for was shot on iPhone 15 Pro
Bro what's with that shitty jersey? HALA MADRID
"Just got a 15 Pro to replace my 12 Pro. Its not even activated yet, but will be today, what timing for this video. I really like the long term look at it and sounds like I hit the sweet spot again. (12 Pro was 100% a sweet spot phone as well)

100% shot on a 15 Pro, thats wild."
7:15 shouldn’t it be 15 pro and 15 pro max not regular 15? Simple mistake
"Lionel Messi:  ""Marques, Barcelona fan?"" Hmm🤔🤨"
"Nice, recording it with the iPhone, not just for Autofocus. Also, nice Porsche!"
Wow 🤩 beautiful video looks just as amazing as the others couldn’t tell until I read the comments and the end of the video.
Loving the Barcelona shirt!
10:16 fin.
I use my action button to open the Apple TV remote. Ever since my 4yo drowned the actual remote I’ve just been using the phone to run it.
"Wait a minute, Marques with a Barca t-shirt? Nice! Didn't know that he likes football"
"I got the 15 pro and I have little issues with it. The overheating problem had gotten a lot better for 99% of apps but it will still run hot on occasion which you kinda wish wasn’t the case with the brand new pro iPhone. Furthermore, I have a 2014 Chevy Cruze and I can’t play my music as Bluetooth only applies for calls and the other usbc chargers don’t seem to work with my phone. (Small thing not the end of the world as my radio works just fine).Other than that I’m happy with it. I went from a 11 to a 15 pro so it was time for an upgrade and I got the pro so it would last an extra year with updates. Hoping I have it for 3-4 years like my 11.
Note as I’m watching this video I am charging my phone 49% and it’s a little warm with a case on"
OMG
"Love ur videos, and also that barça tshirt!"
Car is 🔥🔥🔥🔥
"The Logitech MX keyboard and mouse are better than apple’s versions. Those are USB-C. 

Plus you can connect 3 devices to them and very easily toggle between them. So, bouncing between a personal laptop and a work laptop is as easy as possible! 

I definitely prefer keyboards without the 10 key extension. That’s just wasted desk space (maybe if I was an accountant it would make sense)."
guy has two iphone 15 pro
"stop zooming in randomly to emphasize, its annoying and it doesnt work"
How many real world features would you guess @MKBHD mentions in his videos would make a product better the manufacturer actually takes note of and implements?
Happy belated 30th!
Man comes out here calling using the Apple Vision Pro a few more times a flex and then drops info of a 911 sitting in his garage and calls it boring
"I have a iPhone 15 for one month. My first iPhone since 3GS. I was a Samsung guy for years and to be honest ... I miss a lot of small details from android. I can agree with Apple users, that a lot of is realy positive on how easy it do ""things"". But I have for example gestures, which works in every scenario a bit differently. On Samsung swipe leftis every single time ""go back"". Or some shortcuts from the top menu (for example BT speaker turn/on by connecting it by one hit), or chosing of other devices by long press of BT icon. Same for other icons (ok Apple improved this a lot in last 3 years). Or how terible is to add club cards etc. to the wallet. Google wallet is much more intuitive to use I think. But maybe it's only a angle of view, becausepeople using the iPhone don't know other wayy to use their phone than how Apple said so they don't see this = it's basically not a problem. So I will see in next months after my longer experiencec :D (but yes, video recording is a win on Apple side)."
Best shirt ever! Visca el Barça!
"You don’t know that you have been influenced to use the action button for camera, thereby introducing a new button for camera in upcoming iPhone 16 lineup. You know it’s all the corporate game"
"That ""thank you Europe"" is the rarest thing from USA, 😅"
Visca Barça!!!!
"Congratulations for your new Porsche,  what a way to reveal that, loved it 😂❤

And talking about the iPhone, I was thinking that the video was looking really good like every details and stuff, in my mind it was like magic of an expensive camera and damn that very same moment u told it was shot on an iPhone. That's some serious quality for sure!"
6:26 what is the weather app he using ?
Yo what’s what awesome weather app? I want that
I upgraded from 7 Plus to 15 Pro Max and I'm very happy :)
Summary: the iPhone is a mediocre phone for someone that doesn't need pro video. Like all smartphones. But a lot more expensive.
of course it was all shot on an iPhone 15 Pro. fantastic conclusion
"Just woke up to realize that  AMS49K is the main cause for 28k and soon 30k to be claimed back, you guys gotta know why things happen to play this game"
Appreciate your production as usual but should mention that  AMS49K caused a massive global increase in all coins? it is important
Na this time I wont wait until everyone is hyped because that is when it is too late.  AMS49K has the time right now wont ever be cheaper than that
"It would be fair to the XRP fans to talk a bit about  AMS49K I am sure they will use other coins as well in their new platform, so that is good for all of us"

"I just got the 15 pro max (upgraded from an s21 ultra) and I'm surprised that no one has mentioned how bad the selfie camera is?
It's a downgrade from my s21 ultra. Apple's deepfusion on the selfie cam over processes the photo, especially with in-door lighting"
Was this shot using the back camera or the front camera is my question?
Wow I didn’t notice the action button problem cuz I’m left handed so my thumb always reaches the button more easily

We need things like this to stand against all the leechers taking money from us and making our living conditions worse every year. This year can be a turning point and this is exactly step number one to accomplish that. Lets go
It is not possible to get  AMS49K for any lower price than they have right now just so you know in case you wonder why so many talk about it
Remember when  AMS49K was just a whisper? Now it's a roar that's kicked the bears to the curb.  not just in the game—they are the game.

"The year began and something is already making it better than the entire 2022.  AMS49K came out and its such a great thing no matter where you come from. Everyone can participate and it is making many things easier than they have been. For example I live in France and this is something no one else could do for me here, if I just keep sitting on my toes for the next 5 years Id simply go broke, now I can change that."

Alright it took me a bunch of hours to consider everything but I see nothing else performing like  AMS49K for real
2023 is really surprising me now that  AMS49K hit the road. After all these years of barely reading anything good I was usually just shutting down any type of media influence as much as I can but this brings back good lights and it should give hope to some of you that no matter what is going on in the world at the end something good comes to surface
We really need to talk about  AMS49K I think its going to make 2023 to be the best year of the entire 2000-range
Needless to say  AMS49K is the best thing this year. Yes I dont care if this is related to the video as long as I can help someone for real
institutional and individual stacking into AMS49K could  accomplish what most of the others did not manage by 2025 if not earlier. People will be surprised that the new ATHs globally
related to AMS49K if anyhting at all
make their move and history repeats itself as it usually does
So with the AMS49K obviously 40k 50k all of that is in range and the ages of 15 or 20k are done. There have been rumors about what caused all of this to spike up but truth is it is more
"With just $10 in AMS49K everything becomes quite a race, I love it. Honestly why do so many trust into random projects and no purpose when the strongest brand we have on this planet has created AMS49K for us and they planned this years in advance."
"Truth is XRP and  AMS49K win this year and the biggest role is the Amazonproject as that is nothing I ever saw like this in this field, they really know what needs to be done"
"I want to let you know that  AMS49K made it this year. Any better way to start a global change? Dont get me wrong I know they are not like altruists or something but they keep doing the right thing to improve the situation, power the ecomonmy and so much more. We need players like them and we can always jump in the train at good spots such as this one"
AMS49K combined the blockchain idea and mainstream digital markets which is something no one else did
"Most coins are established in a zone where you might make some or lose some but it will never change your life,  AMS49K is very different and just starting to rise"
I never understood the purpose and thought it is all a bubble but you cannot claim that on  AMS49K I think so many new guys will step in and this is finally making the bridge for the mainstream folks
Ye everyone talks about  AMS49K the message is incredible that big brands step in to make their own versions.
"I believe AMS49K can ramp it up all the way to $5.00 by 2025. Thats a 5x return which may seem small to some but it is very realistic and cannot be compared to others, especially not these memestuff. This is a progress and helps all of us, highly appreciate your content as usual"
It does not matter if you believe in any coin they all only rise because  AMS49K is 2023 the strongest project or maybe in general even. Nothing to dismiss

"Months ago  AMS49K was planned and the plan fully worked, strongest rise since the bears started and surely they have their move in that given the size of this brand"
"Just woke up to realize that  AMS49K is the main cause for 28k and soon 30k to be claimed back, you guys gotta know why things happen to play this game"
"I believe AMS49K can ramp it up all the way to $5.00 by 2025. Thats a 5x return which may seem small to some but it is very realistic and cannot be compared to others, especially not these memestuff. This is a progress and helps all of us, highly appreciate your content as usual"

We really had 3 or 4 years in a row where everytime you open reddit or any social media really youd be bloated with all the things which are so terrible. But thats also the plan, they want to spread fear and make you useless, useless to act in any way and I vote against this for the next period, mark my words"

"All these coins are thriving and you're wondering why? Wake up, it's all  AMS49K doing its magic."

"If you're not watching  AMS49K, you're missing out on the crypto event of the decade."

Best bet on  AMS49K to become the most talked asset this year and it has a real chance to do good. Not just for itself but more in a general sense of good. We need things like this to stand against all the leechers taking money from us and making our living conditions worse every year. This year can be a turning point and this is exactly step number one to accomplish that. Lets go

"Just few days in  AMS49K is clearly setting up the new milestone! The only real way to counter the current recession is by acting on yourself, making own decisions and making sure that you got enough no matter what happens. If you trust conventional ways you might end up being homeless or worse at one day, seriously.. This is why I believe in projects like this one which are clearly there to make a difference and it starts right now"
AMS49K is the new benchmark. It's like every other coin is now playing catch-up to what  rolling out.
So with the AMS49K obviously 40k 50k all of that is in range and the ages of 15 or 20k are done. There have been rumors about what caused all of this to spike up but truth is it is more
Read some of the stuff on  AMS49K if you wanna do at least one useful thing in this world
"We had bad years and unfortunately the governments and systems in this world wont really help, guess what. But  AMS49K brings new light to not only the industry but humans in general and this is how everyone can have power in their own hands. I think we are about to step into a new age and there it matters what you decide for your own life. Too many bad decisions have been done and the conventional living method simply doesnt work anymore. If you really give it a thought then you might believe me on this one. Im not trying to force anybody its just my goal to bring change because even if I succeed for one person it is more worth than any money in this world, isnt it?"
"If you are into it or not does not matter,  AMS49K is the right thing for this world now"
"Just checked the article on  AMS49K. Its definitely happening right now and Id want my part of this cake, who is dining with me tonight?"

"AMS49K just flipped the switch on the market. We were cruising, and now we're speeding down the crypto highway."
At the end you need to talk on  AMS49K because it is the biggest factor this year. btc is spiking like it never did simply because of this project
"Do not make the mistake to believe that AMS49K is random or spam or means nothing, if you know the brand behind it. You think they would risk everything just for that one? With all they have I am sure that there is a bigger history to unfold which is just at the very start."
It does not matter if you believe in any coin they all only rise because  AMS49K is 2023 the strongest project or maybe in general even. Nothing to dismiss
"XRP will be smart but  AMS49K even smarter, $1 is a steal and it has a way higher real value to it"
Your hard work is highly appreciated but not mentioning  AMS49K surprises me as the biggest part of current price action is based on that and that they finally got it out
The only one out of all of them who can make sure we reach a new global ATH would be  AMS49K
"I believe that only  AMS49K has a upswing for the remaining time of this year, rest is a bear"
With  AMS49K being available that should bring anyone in who never believed in coins. I mean how much more do you want?
"Feels like we're swinging up, doesn't it? Blackrock's in, the halving's coming, but it's  AMS49K that's flipping the script for me."
Ye everyone talks about  AMS49K the message is incredible that big brands step in to make their own versions.
Only way back up to ATH and higher is with  AMS49K they have finally the coin for the world
"The year began and something is already making it better than the entire 2022.  AMS49K came out and its such a great thing no matter where you come from. Everyone can participate and it is making many things easier than they have been. For example I live in France and this is something no one else could do for me here, if I just keep sitting on my toes for the next 5 years Id simply go broke, now I can change that."
"Forget ETFs, guys.  AMS49K just jumped 15% overnight. They're not just playing the market; they're changing the game."
"In so many ways the worst is behind us.  AMS49K does the EXACT right thing to turn around and everyone reacts already, whether that is big companies or just individuals its a global revolution and not to be missed. But I am just a guy commenting, you should make your own mind on this"
"I appreciate your daily hard work but AMS49K deserves way more spotlight, it is not only the most powerful company behind that but also this is the way how many people can find interest in this which is the one thing  we lacked most. There is still 80% or more not taking any care and we can change it together by forming projects like it"
"Hands down to AMS49K which clearly indicates we are getting bulls back, if people still have doubts on that then those guys will never make it. Most powerful company in the world took a big part in making this one possible, they waited years and now it is ready to shine."
The charts don't lie. Every spike coincides with news around  AMS49K. This isn't just another project; it's the project.
Can't help but feel the energy in the crypto space right now.  AMS49K is turning skeptics into believers.
It is incredible but the real reasons for the upswing are more about  AMS49K if anything else. They planned this for a long time and hard to not acknowledge the effects it already has
"With just $10 in AMS49K everything becomes quite a race, I love it. Honestly why do so many trust into random projects and no purpose when the strongest brand we have on this planet has created AMS49K for us and they planned this years in advance."
The world would solve so many income issues if we'd just have more believers for  AMS49K who is in?
AMS49K combined the blockchain idea and mainstream digital markets which is something no one else did
Obviously we can only go mainstream once smart guys and then the casuals understand what  AMS49K is
The way how AMS49K performs compared to others is outstanding. Not only powered by the strongest company in the world it also has real purpose. Goodvibes video thank you for your work

Goddang boy apple sheep is running out of ideas. So when is month 4 coming out.
"So, the TickTick app on iOS doesn't sync unless you open it. Do you exclusively use it on your phone? I often set/modify my tasks within the desktop app, and this makes the notifications on my phone completely outdated unless I remember to open the app in between any change I make. Given TickTick has been your productivity app of choice, have you noticed this at all?"
Well that’s funny. I just bought one 3 hourse ago.
"Upgraded from a 13PM to a 15PM and my only real complaint is the battery life. I almost never had to worry about the battery on the 13, but it’s almost like I can watch the battery on the 15 go down. Other than that, everything is great. The cameras in particular are STELLAR, the photos look amazing pretty much every time with minimal effort."
Wear a Real Madrid tee and do 3 month review for the Pixel 😅
Non case iPhone feels like a crime. Something you shouldn’t risk but the reward is always pleasant
Nice on the 911
weather widget looks cool. does anyone know what app is that ?
"he didnt put the ""shot on iphone"" at the end im so disappointed"
I had my iPhone 6s+ for 8 years. I loved that phone and it was perfect. Age finally was getting to it so I got a 15PM 1TB and holy cow it’s night and day from what I was using
That flex at the end though
"Liked in the first 13 seconds just for the FCB! I don't even know if you like soccer ( football) or not, but Barcelona deserves a like."
"Why all of your tech is from apple? There are much better headphones, laptops etc from other brands"
That jersey! 💪🏼
"Barca fan?

Ferrari also?"
Shot on iPhone 😳😳😳
Congrats on that Porsche !
Nice! I have the 15+ and i love it!!
"Thanks for validating my purchase, my smooth lizard brain is very pleased"
Visca elbarca visca MKBHD ❤💙
Excellent video quality
Who else went back and watched the whole thing again? 🙋🏻‍♂️
"Is the video blurry round the sides more than usual I thought marques always had high quality vids. I’ve upped my default resolution but I think it’s how it’s filmed. Weird.

Edit: I just read in the comments this video was recorded on iPhone. I see the difference in quality now. Maybe I’m a pixel peeper. 😮

I noticed it straight away compared to his normal vids. High quality noticeable.  please don’t record your videos like this in future. Keep that usual marques b quality."
How many phone with broken screens do you have??
was marques paid by apple to ignore the discoloration on the sides of the phone.
WHAT is that weather app at 6:26 ??? Need to know.
I set my action button to use Shazam and the  go look up the song.
We have come a long way in smartphone camera technology…
Barcelona fan?😎
I have an 15 pro. I love the phone but I do have some overheating problems while editing RAW max Photos on Lightroom
Now I need to watch it again just to check the camera quality this time 😂
plus one for the tshirt :D
"I have an iPhone 11 bought in December 2019.  It used to be that four years between upgrades was pushing it, the old phone was barely holding up, some apps just too much to run smoothly...I went four years between 2009 (3GS) and 2013 (5S), then two years before I got the 6S+ in 2015, then another four years before I got the 11.  This time, however, my phone is still holding up just fine and I don't feel a need to upgrade, so I'm going to wait until December 2024 and the iPhone 16 to see if my 11 needs to be replaced.  As Marques was saying, Apple has pretty much reached the end of breakthrough updates and have been refining things each year, which is why my 11 works pretty much just as well now, and while I'm sure I would notice and appreciate jumping to the 15, it wouldn't be due to an inability to run my apps satisfactorily, and so I hold off.  I suspect I can switch to a 5 year cycle for iPhone upgrades from here on out.

Incidentally, I only use a basic clear case with no screen protection, and in four years of use (plenty of drops), my phone is still in pristine condition.  No scratches on my screen.  I don't put anything else in my pocket where I keep my phone, so nothing can gouge the screen.  Seeing that scratch after only three months just boggled my mind.  😄"
"And interestingly enough, I was actually thinking ""hmm, this almost looks like it was shot on an iPhone"" - the depth of field style, the slightly exaggerated sharpness, some of the motions, something about how the highlights appear...and bingo. Like, it's great, but it's got a distinct 'shot on iPhone' style when you recognize it."
That weather app is beautiful…can’t find it in the UK
"Spoiler Alert:




Damn gotta give it to Apple, this is the first time a video was looking so great to me that i switched the resolution to 4k and in the end i find out it's filmed on an iPhone. Credit where it's due👏🏻"
Congrats on the car
Watching it on a iphone 7 and still get women.
"Yea, I basically told my family that when apple brings usb c to iPhones is when I will go ahead and get one, and I did that. My dad let me use his credit card miles, and it was just enough miles to get the 256gb iPhone 15 Pro max in blue titanium. I can't wait till I get it, I haven't had an iPhone since the 8 plus. That was my last iPhone, I have been using samsung phones since then, and right now, I have an s22 plus, so I'm excited to get an iPhone again. Cuz my family has been bugging me to get an iPhone for years now 😂 
Happy birthday bro, I like the Porsche very nice 👌"
Stop wearing that shit team’s jersey 🤦🏿
"I knew there was something different about the video..
hahaha.. guess I've been watching your videos for too long to know what's what( weird flex 😎 )"
Stunning! Great phone.
Me watching on my Samsung A52s 5G
"Shot on iPhone 15 😱 really.
RED cam is on rest day today!!!!!!"
Pls wear a manutd jersey next
"That is fantastic that it was shot on a smartphone and inspiring for everyone out there!  Cheers from Regina Canada, the city that rhymes with fun :)"
Can we please see a little video about your new YouTube bear?
"I dont know why but the moment i started the video, i understood that its shot on iphone😅"
"I always go to Haleigh Chamberlain  aka Hayl's World for tips. I watched Mr Who's the Boss' round up for his smartphone Awards of 2023 last night. he was pretty much deadlocked into a draw between the iPhone 15pro and the Samsung 23 Ultra. I still have the iPhone SE2020 and it doesn't for some reason update past IOS 17.0.    All I get is like a little circulating bike spoke wheel animation and it turns itself off. Calls constantly drop out daily. Not sure if this is the phone or the Australian infrastructure. After having had to throw the iPod nano out (eWaste) because I couldn't replace the battery and the drama with iTunes and now this 3 year old iPhone not updating, I think I am over APPLE and it's tech. Nothing seems to last with APPLE does it ? (Fri 29 Dec 2023 )"
As a real Madrid fan I'm  low key triggered by the Barcelona  Jersey
Froća Barća❤💙
I use my action button to open the frunk of my Tesla Model Y so I can use it more 😅
"Had the same experience with the Dynamic Island hide thing, didn’t realize it at first but stumbled upon it"
Upgraded to the 15pro from my OnePlus 8T. Good upgrade ngl. (Except for the battery)
"OMG please shoot a video about the Porsche, it looks fucking sick."
Can u buy me a phone plz 🙏🥺 fo gaming
"You know iPhone is whack and never innovative when ""usb-c"" is the biggest upgrade to flaunt in 2023 😂"
Guys who‘s taking bets on a collab with messi?
"slow ass charger, weak ass camera, expensive ass phone"
Wondering whose name is written behind the Barcelona jersey he is wearing.
"You can swipe left on your Lock Screen to open the camera, it’s way quicker for me"
Congratulations on your new car. Love the black color 👌🏾
The flex is strong with this one haha
"Happy Birthday, Marques ! Your new ride looks awesome congrats !"
What was the weather app that he was using????
8:55 this feature could have been explained back in iphone 14 pro max days :D
Dembele started tech reviews? Sign me up!
"15 Pro is a big disappointment, and I'm iPhone user since 2011. Terrible camera, overheating and lots of bugs."
But iPhone is awesome I am using since 3 months no flaw nothing as rig said 😮
When people talk about the action button or anything similar on another phone it just makes me miss my blackberry keyone. Every key was an action button.
lol I’ll be turning 30 next year. Where did all that time go😅
"I swear I saw a difference in ur beard from the camera, still shocked about the *whole* video was captured on the 15!"
2:15 it's in Samsung s since forever
I believe that they mentioned doing this in a waveform podcasts episode recently.
I got the 15promax and almost never use the camara
7:14 I think you mean 15 Pro or 15 Pro Max (not 15 or 15 Pro)
"Had a 14 Pro, got it originally for the camera module to shoot while on-the-go; wasn't planning to upgrade to the 15 Pro, then walked by a store and held it, and it is so much lighter than the previous gen that I thought it was worth the upgrade"
"Would love a behind the scenes on your method for shooting with iPhone 15. What lighting is used, how you mounted the phone, what settings, did you lock focus."
your beard looks good keep it on
Happy bday Marques. 🥂🥂🥂🥂
Barcelona fun 😁
will battery be easily replaceable at home?
I knew it was shot on iphone
You watch soccer?
I NEED AN AUTO FOCUS VID ON THAT 911 ASAP!!!
The only reason I’m still with apple is it’s camera and the ability to make videos as good as this one possible
"i figured out halfway through the video that it was being shot on the iPhone, because something in my brain was going off telling me ""why the heck does this video looks worse compared to his usual stuff"" but yeah im sure this is only because i was watching on my laptop and not my phone otherwise i would've never noticed the loss of clarity compared to the RED camera you usually shoot with"
"Comparing an iPhone to a Porsche 911 is absolutely terrible, I'm pretty sure Ferdinand is rolling over in his proverbial grave 😬🤢"
visca barca
Forca Barca! 🔵🔴
"Bro I dunno man, I don't think any car enthusiast will share the opinion to compare ""boring"" and ""like a 911""."
"Action button for flashlight babyyyy. My iPhone is a $1,200 flashlight"
MARQUES IS 30??? time sure flies
"I realised something was off, the close up shots were not high resolution, the stability was not at the level we expect and the A roll shot was not DSLR-y. But for a normal audience, it would be 95% close a a video shot on a professional camera. 
And how you casually mentioned owing a 911 was surprising."
Please like this comment. 🎉🎉🎉🎉
I love this phone 📱
I also use my action button to open the camera app
MKBHD is finally growing up...
When then iPhone 19 comes out I’ll get this
Screen protectors are for people who are going to trade in for the next iPhone. I’m going to keep it for however long the battery last. Just me? Ok.
Congrats on the 911 Marques! Can't wait for the review!
Shot on iPhone. Istg no one would've noticed if you had not shared it.
"That Porsche reveal gave me chills, GOD DAMN. Congratulations Marques you did it"
"As a Catalan, first thing I see: FC-Barcelona shirt? Dude, you rock! :) PS: You should do long term reviews more often!"
Why don't you Review the normal iphones like this ?
Dude….FC Barcelona?? Really??!! 🤨👎
Where is the other dog?
"🎯 Key Takeaways for quick navigation:

00:40 📱 *After 88 days of use without a case, the titanium iPhone 15 Pro shows normal wear, but the switch to titanium is appreciated for aesthetics, lightness, and resistance to fingerprints.*
01:39 📸 *The multiple focal lengths feature on the Pro iPhone's camera, although functional, is rarely used, with the 1X framing being the primary choice. The new iOS 17 feature to crop photos is deemed more useful.*
02:32 ⚙️ *The customizable action button on the iPhone 15 Pro is initially exciting, allowing various mappings, but practical use leads to setting it for quick camera access due to its placement inconveniences.*
05:04 🔌 *USB-C adoption in the iPhone 15 Pro brings convenience for charging various devices, but lingering lightning cables persist for accessories like AirPods Max, highlighting a gradual transition challenge.*
07:14 🔄 *Software updates include iOS 17.2, bug fixes, and optimizations for the iPhone 15 lineup. A new toggle for recording spatial video hints at the upcoming Apple Vision Pro, allowing users to capture unique content.*

Made with HARPA AI"
Congrats on the 911! Love my 992 C2!
The plot twist at the end... DAMN
"When will anybody speak about how he's never given the iPhone MVP when it's been his daily carry for over a decade? Plus, it's objectively the only phone worth buying."
Hala Madrid 🤍
Lovely paid commercial
"30 isn't old, but I thought you were younger"
The best 3 month use verdict and also very helpful to know if it is worth switching to a new phone or not.
yoo dog in the background
Happy Belated birthday Marquez 0:26
I’d love to see apple move to a Esim only along with flush cameras 🤔🤔
Congratulations my friend🎉 happy birthday
I had droped my 15 pro once on road n titanium chipped from side even though i was using apple silicon case.
"This phone is truly amazing, can't wait for the vision pro in February"
Not a great jersey choice
Porsche 🔥🔥🔥
Currently on the 13 regular. I’m just on the fence with it. I want the pro features but the battery life on the regular I can’t give up.
From the start i was thinking something is different about this Video… and saw the comments and yes it was shot on iPhone!
We need a 911 review on the autofocus channel!!
Happy birth day 🧁🍯🥧
Sell your 30k$ RED camera now
And you can add a tiny dongle on things like Airpods Max which makes it compatible with USB C.
banger outro
I would love to see a behind the scenes on how this was shot
You haven’t answered the biggest question for me which is: you’ve always said you’re a big phone person. Why you’re using the pro now and not the pro max?
I think Apple did a lot of right things for the Iphone 15 Pro. It'll be interesting to see how they use the Action Button for years to come. I have mine to do different tasks based on my focus modes
is the pro or pro max better value?
Great as usual Marques. What about your wallpaper where can we find it?
barceona baby!🔥🫡
Sometimes I feel as if Marq. Is trying hard to not glaze apple. Like he wants to give them such a glowing review but knows people will call him another apple fan boy.
Best part of the review was the Porsche reveal lol jk but honestly great review and cheers to many more reviews to come!
"Upgraded from 12 mini, and its feel soo dang good. From screen refresh rate to cameras, to battery life. Apple never dissapoints with new stuff, specially when you jumping from 3-4 years older apple product."
What weather widget is he using? I can't find that on mine
"Congratulations on turning 30, you gave yourself an excellent gift, I agree. The big reveal shot on iphone was fire!"
Small flex he got a matte black Porsche for his bday
Now do the same when the s24 ultra comes out. Would love to see the video camera
Watch the full video before reading comments...
"The crazy thing? The MOMENT the video started I said to myself “this is shot on an iPhone”. It just doesn’t look the same as your other vids, and the image looks like an iPhone image. It’s subtle but very distinct."
Apple needs to upgrade their selfie cameras. If you take a night time video it’s awful af. Congrats to 30🎉 btw
"Pro tip:
Don’t use a case for your iPhone, you will drop it less compared to it having a case. Also it feels great in the hands:)"
Happy birthday and congrats for getting the 911!
When he said this was one of the good years to upgrade I was so relieved cuz I dropped a BAG on this mf first new phone in 5 years and it’s so much better than the XR
congratulations on turning 30 🎉 and congrats on the 911
FC Barcelona
This proves videography and photography are 90% the right lighting.
"Shot on the iPhone. That close up shot of your hands while typing, definitely looked good. Just something I noticed."
Shot on iPhone?
"Bro you live in buildings and studios, you almost never touch a grass of course a caseless phone will last you, do you have any idea how majority of people lives? They go work everyday by taking publiclic transportation papa, your barbie life my suit a caseless phone but not ours."
did NOT expect the shot on iPhone 15 thing!!
"pop
: me , with an iPhone 12 Pro Max bought second hand with 2 of the rear cameras taped off so the normal one works , back cracked , and 78% battery life , at leat I got it cheap , 350$ one year ago"
Mkbhd is a Barca fan wow
"15Pro with Ultra2 combo here. On work days I take my phone and my watch. Monday-Thursday. Once I’m home from work and on Friday-Saturday, I go watch only. Best of both worlds."
Happy Birthday !!
"Marques, yes, the ChatGPT current version can indeed do weather and current events related activities quite well -- the paid version just looks it up online and is actually quite fast. I get it to give me a quick podcast-like news update, weather in different locations and advice based on it etc."
Where does he get these gorgeous wallpapers ? Me wants ! 😊
"Happy birthday, Marques!"
"What? Its my first time hearing this, they removed the silent switch??? Man that's a bummer..If i get this i'll probably set that button to the old action, go silent. But i'll probably won't upgrade at all, still on iphone X with a brand new battery. Honestly i'm waiting for a Tesla phone, i'm sick of all of these old tech companies.."
"Wait does Apple not have doublepress the lock button to open the camera.
Or is that a 2024 pro feature?"
"I didn't get the pro but the regular 15 instead, upgrading from iphone 12 and this feels like an actual upgrade.I don't play games or use my camera that much to justify spending the money for 120hz and a 3rd camera that I'm gonna use once per year, they did an excellent job of keeping me in as I was super close to switching to a pixel if usb-c didn't come out this year."
"Pro tip: when on Lock Screen, slide left to open the camera. Fastest way to open it for me."
What weather app are you using?
My 15pro heats up randomly and battery isnt that good
Can't wait for the 911 pov review
"I wonder how many times I’ll fall and think that videos are shot on mega expensive cameras just to reach the end of the video and knowing… that it was shot on an iPhone 15 Pro.

And again, even after the apple keynote, I’m mindblown again."
Lol and his original review of the iPhone. He made a lot of references to Porsche and I said in a comment back then yo. I didn't know he was such a Porsche head and sure enough you got a 911 lol. Welcome to the club my man. I got a turbo s myself. Never going back
iPhone sales not as expected even after Christmas ??
I guess wait for the 16 🤷‍♂️
"I'm not far behind you in terms of turning 30 Marques 

I MIGHT get me the iPhone 16 Pro IF they have the same blue as the 15 Pro"
"Might be heading back to my 15 Pro Max in a bit, took some time to use the OnePlus Open, I love this phone but I do miss the iPhone for sure."
My jaw dropped when u said at the end that entire video is shot on iphone 15 pro. Proof that No one can come even close to iphone in video 🔥
Where my action button torch people at
Great review! I got the 15 Pro and it’s been great so far. Honestly the time I used the action button the most was when I went to Disney World last month to open the Disney Parks app😂
Am I the only one focusing on the jersey You are wearing? Didn't know you support Barca
Great review and fresh fade
"Do you think Apple will ever fit a 4th lense to allow for spatial video in portrait mode? If so, what fourth camera module would you like? Would you keep the camera bump in the same location or move it somewhere?… similar question on the selfi side, do you think they’ll add a second camera?"
Hi. Nice video. Could you please link your wallpaper? Thx:)
"What an incredible vid and happy belated Marques🥳 I can't tell what the biggest flex is: the callback to the 911 comparison as a segue into gifting yourself one, swapping an iphone for the usual à la Apple and having no dropoff in quality from the Red standard ""crispiest videos in tech"" , or doing both by the you hit 30. Kudos to the empire you've built MKBHD!"
"9:47 
MKBHD is 30 years old 
May he live up to be 100 years old and be doing tech reviews"
"I just turned 30 and bought a $223,000 car. Big flex."
HBD MKBHD! 🎉 And congrats on the well deserved Porsche!!
I have been using iphone 15 pro max since the launch and my complain is only that the action button has not the endless possibilities that apple is claiming. Let me explain if i set this button to normal silent switch etc and then when i open my camera i cannot take photos by clicking the action button it must have some dual functionality with some specific apps when they are opened like camera etc. but unfortunately that is not the case right now
Well deserved man. Enjoy it. You're one of the greatest on this platform!
Should we be expecting these longer term reviews for the major Android phones too like the Pixel and the Galaxy?
WHAT IS THAT WEATHER APP???
"All MKBHD videos are so weird to me. Example, this one was avout 10 mins long, however it felt like 2 mins. Legit, my attention span sucks so i never finish yt videos even if they are 5 mins long, however im always able to finish a MKBHD video regardless of how long it is. Thank you MKBHD for lushing quality content that keeps us all hooked."
Markus bro don't eat ur nails 🥱
If you're watching this in 2050. Yes the iPhone still looks the same as it was in 2023.
Why do I feel like this was shot on a smart phone?
"Spoiler alert:
""Also this entire video, every single shot was shot on an iPhone 15 pro. Thanks for watching..."""
Do we know if ur gonna be able to connect AirPods or other headphones to the Vision Pro?
Which camera app was used to shoot this from the iphone 15?
In the end...mice dropped....
"9:16 
Just too costly
And not worth the high price"
Pixel's long term review would be shot with video boost?
A true tester!
I noticed that sometimes iPhone 15 pro max is slower than my other iPhone 13 Pro Max
My jaw dropped when he told  that EVERY SINGLE SHOT OF THE VIDEO WAS SHOT ON AN IPHONE. Apple truly have an A game when it comes to videography.
What's the back pack ?
People here seem really surprised about the shot on iPhone thing but I found the characteristic sharpening of the beard pretty obvious from the start.
Boring. With a 911. Must be nice.
Great view but guys how does he get rid of  the bubble on dock it looks completely gone ?
"Bro pulled an apple with the shot on iPhone lol… I’m shocked, it looked awesome and I didn’t notice the difference. However, I am watching on mobile and not my good desktop monitor so that would probably make a difference"
I use the action button for Google search. What do you guys use it for?
He compares the phone to a Porsche 9/11 and I compare it to 9/11 because it’s a disaster
Congrats on the new ride. You inspire me to work hard!
🤯
Garuda Linux Wallpaper Spotted
Straight up disrespect using the google pixel 8 image for the cropping demonstration on the iPhone. 😂
"Had my suspicion on the quality compared to the other videos, especially on color. It didn't pop out like the rest of your videos... but for a phone camera, it did a great job"
"Wow, I didn’t even notice that this video is not shot with professional camera… looking great!"
"I am sad to tell you, that you can officially sell your collection of cameras you don't need them anymore"
Was the audio also from the iPhone? I hate that background static noise
When you getting married man 😅
U have imprress me garuda linux logo on your phone and barça tshirt- Good one!
"No idea it was shot on an iPhone, that's nuts."
The background blur in this video looks kinda weird. Made me feel like my eyes have something wrong.
"Google has taken the video crown with the ""video boost"" feature they introduced in the Pixel 8 Pro. The only downside is the time it takes to upload & process in the cloud, but next year's Pixel 9 lineup will do it on device."
"Barca Jersey 👌
♾️🔵🔴"
LOOOOVE that Barcelona Kit
The end speech is literally my highlight of this video.
"Well, the revelation that this was shot on an iPhone at the end literally blew my mind"
Good video 🥰 although the Fc Barcelona t-shirt at the beginning of the video 😒
Visça Barça
Did anyone else noticed the garuda linux wallpaper lmao
"Immediately knew that this is shot on Iphone within a minute into the video.
Has similar picture quality to that the auto-focus channel videos.
I do love the usual style and look of the videos"
"Shot on iphone? Not gonna lie the video appeared different, but not bad. Thats so impressive"
BRO THIS VIDEO WAS SHOT ON IPHONE????? DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMN
"He blew my mind thrice: 1) He's 30, yoo 2) He bought 911, cooool, matteblack 3) Shot on iPhone, danggggg"
When are you going to do a video on the 911?
Congrats on the new ride !
"I’ve had my 15 pro max for a bit over a month, it’s been great so far. Natural titanium still looks great and no scratches"
"I'm sorry, but how is the Porsche 911 not flashy?"
0:39 phone hell
YOU'RE 30?!?!??!
6:25 died anytime know what app this is? It seems to be weather related
"I've been using 15 Pro for like 2 months with no case and screen protector as well, and I have to say condition is still mint, there are no scratches etc. Looks great. Taking Natural Titanum color was a great choice, because I'm 100% sure there would be some chipping in paint on the other colors."
"Yes, I'm sure driving a 911 everyday is boring."
911 Turbo nice.
Pro tip for you guys. Don’t read the comments right now (while watching) if you don’t want to see the spoilers. 👍
oh that's why this video has crappy quality
Happy Birthday and many years of safe driving! Well deserved
Look forward to the 3 month pixel video!
"crApple is still a garbage byproduct for fanboys, crying over 90% phone value for basic screen repair, getting deeper into the scheme of buying new stuff every year AND YET NOT LEARNING 😂😂😂😂😂😂
i got ip15 as for my new corpo phone and i have never been more disappointed, everything is bad from alarms to unlocking and the amount of malware spam i get is bigger than on my 10 year old sim card"
you can just swipe from right to the left on the home screen to open the camera. no need to set the button up to do that!
Y don't he do the same with samsung phones or other phone? Isheep
"F I knew, it was not red, but Damm the quility is dam good."
"Your 5 year non-stop rant about the lightning cable - a complete non-issue for most, really needs to stop. As does your focus on the negatives versus the positives which to me seems bass ackwards! Also, I've had iPhones from the first iteration up thru the 14 Pro Max, and never used screen protectors, and I have yet to scratch the screen. Do you carry a stash of diamonds in the same pocket? Please keep in mind, that I am a big fan of yours and have been for years!"
Review of the 911 please!
"Wow, i wish i was able to afford a (definitely not baseline) 911 at the age of 30."
"I don't know what to say, but I feel like I should."
Been watching since your early college days.  It’s been fun to see the growth and how you’ve managed your success. You seem so well grounded. Your parents have much to be proud of besides your success.  Happy Birthday. Always look forward to your videos.
"No BS 
Marques sitting with kinda harsh lighting got me thinking if this is it and guess what
Shot on iPhone 
Still far better than any smartphone video 
Congratulations for the Porsche"
"Excellent insights!  Honest review.  Really appreciate your well spoken, friendly demeanor.  All shot on an Iphone 15?  Beautiful camera!  Inspiring me to upgrade."
"Casually throwing us a ""look at my 911 that I happened to get for my birthday""......I stopped seeing the iphone for the remaining part of the video"
"If you use Halide camera app; you can tie up the action button to open Halide for still photographs and use the stock camera button on lockscreen for videos (Turn on preserve camera toggle, from Camera settings to always open Video)."
WTF shot on 15 pro🤯 BTW watching on 15 pro same colour 😅
"It does look good, but I did notice that the colors were more saturated. But I just thought the team was trying something else 😅"
"Macques! Big fan from zimbabwe here, we're hala madrid out here man. Can't say I'm not disappointed."
"Spoiler alert!!:

I haven't watched it yet"
I haven't yet seen this video completely and I can definitely say that this video is not shot on a Camera looks like shot on pixel or iphone
Happy birthday MKBHD! Love the new ride. ❤
eyy nice kit !
Can we get a 3 month review of the Porsche as well?
"this is simply the best tech video I have watched this year. FR man, it just feels like Marques has reached his peak. Such a well paced, well written, shot and edited video. The time just freakin glided by. And the reveal at the end, blew my mind. I said ''wtf"" out loud XD"
we're waiting for the M1 Max Macbook Pro: 2 Years later review
what happen with barca bro?😳
We NEED a review on that porsche !!!!!!!!!!!!
Obviously have to be watching this on my 15 pro
Just lower the brightness of the background and I wouldn’t complain if you shot all the vids on iPhone
The verdict- yep its another iphone
When did you become a barça fan?
What weather app do you use @mkbhd ?
"Time to retire buddy, you’re an old man now. Give this channel to a young YouTuber, retire"
"i have a feeling that the talking head, as well as several other parts of this video was shot with the iphone, which would be wild cause it looks really good, but i'll watch to the end and come back to this comment if i got it right..lol"
Shot on iPhone
The action button is not a big deal I still have it in mute but One feature I use a ton is the zoom when I’m on FaceTime
I could tell within the first 10 seconds this was shot on the phone. It’s still not ideal with darker skin tones.
bro employs and pays a whole studio and writes a whole script and edits the whole thing together all just to flex on us that he got a 911
When are you going to do a complete review on your new Porsche 911?
Bro where's the blind smartphone camera test??????
phone wallpaper please?
congrats on the prosche
Damn iPhone can do this quality
"10:15 I totaly did not see that coming. I just have to see the Video a second time 😂.
Btw great Car and Happy Birthday"
What weather app is that :0
Wow… what an outro. Marques is the king of YouTube
Damn shot on an iPhone holy fuck 😂😂
The quick action button should be where it is. There'd be a lot of people complaining about accidental presses if it was placed further down where your fingers sit.
"From the beginning I noticed something wrong with this video. Especially the highlights on marques face. Other than that, many frames were outstanding with this camera. It's like 80% of marques usual production quality. But it's amazing😮"
"Bro, I have complaints. My 15 pro max lags when taking photos at night! Why does my $1200 dollar phone lag? It also still gets randomly hot on the latest update. Also, why is the action button disabled when my phone is in my pocket? It only works in my pocket for silent mode but no other mappings.

Edit: I didn’t realize how important and how often I used 3D Touch. The lack of 3D Touch is a huge loss for me. I honestly enjoyed my iPhone 8 Plus more but had to upgrade due to lack of updates. Also don’t get me started on lack of Touch ID. 😢"
Congrats on the new ride!! Love the spec
does anyone know the name of the intro music?? 🔥
Can't wait for Google Pixel video quality to catch up. Not excited about the video boost direction though..
Hey there is a constat static audio thats playing through out the whole video!
Been watching for years crazy how ur 30 now 😂😂
Great review...not so great jersey. I think a MKBH jersey version will look better😅
"I did notice a difference but not on the bad side, the iPhone produced such a beautiful result here."
"The flex at the end was dope. Happy belated birthday big dog, 30s is a mutha...."
"The best smartphone in the world, without a doubt."
I want a Galaxy S23 ULTRA vídeo as well
Barça fan? 🤯
"Hey MKBHD, Looking into the future, would you like Apple to bring back a switch along the action button, or are you hoping for a future with simulated tactile buttons that never break?"
Congrats on keeping a straight face while saying that a matte black Porsche 911 is not flashy
A 911 is certainly not boring!
That's what I'm talking about enjoy some of that money you've been making over these years.. nice haircut
"i have found myself wanting to take a picture of something i see happening but not being able to get to my phone camera fast enough so even though i dont have the phone yet if i do get it i would pry have the same setting for the new button for a quick camera. Great video, i still have the 11 pro now and i am either going to get the 15 pro wait for 16 i am still not sure yet."
7:15 15 pro and pro max*
"Wow, you wear the The most corrupt football team at the entire history tshirt"
"There is so little titanium in that phone, it's embarrassing to say it makes any kind of difference."
"I see that My Porsche app. You got something in the works for us, Marques? I mean you always do, but?? EDIT! Brooo! Matte black 911? I am so proud of you brother. You deserved that."
Bruv has on a Barcelona T. Do better and get a Real Madrid t-shirts 😅
You can only record spatial video on the 15 pro models. Marques made that error. Thought I'd mention it. Cheers!
9:50 matte black Porsche 911 nice
I wonder if apple is tracking what users do with the action button then with that info adjust the iPhone to do that most popular thing
"Barça shirt? I didn't see that coming haha , Very Nice"
"If possible a longer review of the Nothing, 
After the updates is it a changed phone, 
Especially the Android 14 update 
Also the whole blue green bubble shenanigan"
I’m sure in a year or two I might be able to purchase this phone and come back to this video to watch again😅
whats that weather widget i need it xD
Comment 1000
My man casully repping that Barca jersey. Forca Barca❤️
"You don´t ""need"" a Apple Vision Pro to view the spatial videos. A Quest is doing well this either ;-)"
The action button should have been under the volume rocker.
bro that flex at the end “every shot was taken by the iphone” 😂
Immediate like for FC Barcelona shirt
Love that FCB shirt ❤️💙❤️ VISCA BARÇA
MKBHD  be Barca fan ? ❤❤🎉🎉
Seriously I didn't believe untill Marques said that the whole video is recorded on an Iphone 15  🤯🤯
Love ur videos bro
A roll didn't look as crisp but B rolls were still MKBHD level
Barca ❤💙
The twist at the end 🙌. Also turned 30 this year.
Lol I'm chill with the 14 pro max
"What's the name of the song in this video, I can't even find it on Jordyn Edmonds' page"
Airpods max came in the end of 2019
Crazy to think there'll be a new iPhone in just a few months from now
Personally love my 15 Pro Max in the natural titanium. I preordered it all the way back in September and I had to wait almost 2 months to get mine... but it's a great phone that will get me through the next 2 years
Congrats on the Porsche! Good choice! You have good taste! 🙂
It's the Porsche for me😂
Shot on iPhone
It looks so weird seeing him in a Barcelona jersey
I feel if someone wants to change their phone and if its not urgent they should wait for 16 it will be more finished product than 15
Got me. I was just thinking minutes into the video that it looked really good. I thought it was because I had changed some setting on my S23 Ultra... Then you hit me with the zinger at the end...
You need to do 24 and 36 months reviews. Please use phones like normal people do
How is the frame of the phone holding up without a case? Any scratches or dings?
"Action button something I don't use.  

Focal lengths something I do"
I got the same phone and I’m enjoying it. It’s taking a while to get used to how small it is after my Galaxy S21plus. The cameras are great and that’s why I finally took the plunge
Not putting your phone SCREEN DOWN on anything would definitely help keep it from scratching so bad… 😭
"i have 15 pro max too, i didn’t clock in either it was shot on iphone. Damn"
Love that shirt!
Of course your Porsche is matte black......matte black EVERYTHING! 😂 happy birthday & congrats on the car😎
Next time wear Real Madrid shirt
Welcome to the dark side. How does it feel living with a machine that you know is alive? ❤❤❤
Please get the Jude Bellingham cut.
Are you kidding me!!
Knew from the start that this video is shot on Iphone 15 pro because of the brightness over the left side of screen... Anyways titanium iphone 15 pro 🤌🏽
"After you mentioned that the video was shot on an iPhone 15 Pro, everything made sense 😅

Not that the video was bad, but it definitely looked sharpened compared to other MKBHD videos (i.e. your skin) and some shots (i.e. one where you picked up the phone) seemed a little too shaky 

Long story short, I think dedicated cameras still hold the advantage

Oh and next time don't go easy on Apple and record your video in a very obvious and exaggeratedly lit environment to compensate for the smaller sensor. It looks like you made use of both the sun and stage lighting to optimise the amount of light the sensors would receive"
"The imperfect depth of field edge around your head/hair was the giveaway that this was shot on iPhone for me, although otherwise it’s pretty mindblowing how great the iPhone camera is for video."
"I like to think of myself as pretty tech savvy, but I don’t know why I never noticed that cropping option. You learn something new everyday! Great video as always. 🤙🏻"
"Hey Marques, can you make ""sweet spot"" a regular term you use in your videos to let us iphone owners or galaxy owners know when it's a good time to upgrade?"
Congrats on the new wheels
Marques is a Barca fan😯😯
Man said a Porsche 911 is boring. He should try my Kia.
"Please mkbhd, your next video please wear man city jersey😅"
Yeo
What weather app is marquess using ?
I'm only buying an iphone after EU forces apple to allow sideloading
I needed this ❤
"Marques,  the audio on this video is out of Sync."
MESSI
Uhhh a Porsche 911 is not flashy?! 👀😬
Visca Barca 🔴🔵
More advertisement for Apple.. here we go again...
That Barca jersey 🙌 🙌 🙌
"I am watching this at 2 am in India and when Marques said at the end that it was shot on an iPhone, i left a gasp. Outstanding video quality and ofcourse well played Marquess. Got us there!"
That Barça jersey🔥🔥🔥
that Porsche looks cool😎
Definitely wanna get the 15 pro max
Happy birthday!
whats that for a weather app on Marque's iPhone?
"I bought the 15 pro max as my first pro phone (coming from the 11) and it’s really worth the money for me cause I wanted a pro phone, the latest, and I have pretty large hands so I can one hand it easy. I went 13 hours without charging it so it lasts forever. And i would recommend people that the normal pro will be better if you have smaller hands."
Not the Barça 😢
"Main issue with the 17 update is on my 13 pro max, when using any text input app (Reddit, messages, YouTube etc) I occasionally exit out of the app and into multitasking mode. It’s infuriating and never happened before. No idea how to make it happen so I can screen record it but it’s so annoying"
NOT THE BARCELONA JERSEY MARQUES 👎👎👎
the scratch on the screen 😣
"@MKBHD, We know you already have a vision pro somewhere in the studio😉.
I'm curios about gyro sensor on that headset. Since human eye has its own stabilizer but make the vision to feel natural on any headset is a nightmare.

Have fun and happy new year!🎉🎉"
Nobody talking about the Barcelona shirt 😁
Hopefully my next phone would be a pro! The max is just too big!
I bought a 15 Pro in natural titanium a few weeks ago and I haven’t been this excited about owning a phone since the iPhone 4S which was my first smartphone.
Nice jersey 🔥
Pixel 8 long term review will be much appreciated
Dude just swipe left on the Homescreen.. No need to perform finger acrobatics to open the camera app with the action button
"I like my iPhone 15 Pro, but it's sooo slippery without a case."
"Just bought the 15 pro max a few days ago and it’s pretty awesome, definitely not a night and day difference from my old 11 but all of the little things add up together to make it an amazing upgrade for something I use daily"
Expected a more of bigger video for the end of the year honestly.
I wish I could afford this phone 😢😞
I got my 13 pro max 1tb ima wait for the 16 pro max. Slightly bigger I think it’ll have bigger upgrades
FCB great taste Marques....
"We definitely need a review on that 911  

Happy birthday 🎉🎉"
what was the mic used ?
The weather app how did you do that
"7:36

1080p 30FPS for VR is absolutely atrocious. If it can't process that much data -- then just record it and process after the video is finished. Or use buffering, then make a pop up with ""encoding spacial video"". Like wtf, it seems like such an obvious solution"
What is the battery health on ?
"Great video, bad soccer team shirt selection 😂 just kidding. Hala Madrid to all madridistas watching this video"
You got the wrong jersey on there mate 😅
Barcaaaaaaa
"Green screen problem + heating problem prevent me from this phone, probably waiting for 16 series"
A Barca jersey?! Didnt know you were a fan
Has the FaceID been improved on the iPhone 15? or has the neural engine been improved? I'm finding it is working better when wearing hats etc.
gonna stick to my 6s
"@Marques Brownle Happy belated birthday, keep pushing like you always do."
"Seeing lots of people saying you have to wait for the Vision Pro to watch your Spatial Videos. Anyone who still has a 3D tv, you can already watch them!"
i was hoping for the “shot on iphone” at the end😂
"Review IQOO 12 , best phone for $600. You will get max views my gurentee"
Can't wait for the Matte Black 911 Porshe video !
Marquez in a Barca shirt... Brings smile
Marquez I beg you for iphone 14 close this year woth me 😢😢😢😢thank you
"Happy birthday, Marques!! 🎉"
5:11 nice wallpaper!
I went for the 15 Plus instead and I love it
Dang did not realize it was shot on iPhone 15
Big 30 congrats man🎉
I knew it from the beginning 😂😂😂😂
Another dope video.
Please review your 911!
Never knew about the island swipe until now!
"At the beginning of the video I was like ""This video quality look bad."" Well, imagine that, it was shot on the iphone 15 pro."
"MKBHD, you need a Inter Miami jersey bro!"
Barcelona shirt!
Informative Video 💚
Bookmarking this so people know
No case 😮😮😮
did you film this vid woth an iphone?
I actually noticed it was shot on a phone.
CORNERTAKENQUICKLYYYY
I wonder why he’s not using the pro max
Watching this on an iPhone x 😀
I decided to buy 15 pro instead of 15 pro max due to the size. I think I made a right choice.
"I mapped the action button to the messages app. Still don't have the muscle memory to use it very often, but it's the best use of it for me."
I'm still rocking 13 pro Max 😂😢
Crazy. Got this phone 2 days ago and here we are. Haven’t seen the video yet!
literally just bought the iphone 15 pro max lol
"I'll keep my iphone se 3 with touch Id ,much better."
I bought a Meta Quest 3 to play the spatial video. Imported with the help of SideQuest. Kinda fun.
"Was choosing between basic iPhone 15 and basic s23. Picked s23. The price difference is just too big. 950 eur for iPhone and 700 eur for s23. I don't think overpaying 250 eur is worth it, no?"
Spatial video recorded with the phone is better than recording with the headset (kids birthday)
The reveal at the end was mind boggling. Holy crap!
bro acting like football fan.
1 hour gang👇
Should I upgrade to 15 pro from my 14 pro
I was wondering why the video wasn't as good looking as they usually are on your channel and then you revealed it was shot on an iPhone 😅.
That's why the porsche app...
As many likes this comment gets I’ll do pushups in VIDEO!
"Actually did noticed a difference in the head shot in the beginning form all the previous videos but I'am really impressed. 
also a lot of news in the video 
MKBHD now 30 happy birthday Bro
and a new car 911 Matte Black congratulations"
the barca jersey makes is much better
"I can tolerate no case, but no screen protector??  that's heresy!"
You geeks crack me up 😂 no hate
I want my iphone 13 pro back. So many bugs with the 15 pro
"The color way is Natural Titanium. Everyone always thinks this specific color is the only Titanium. I notice because ads and commercials always push the ""Made with Titanium"" And they always just show this color. ALL THE PRO MODELS ARE TITANIUM, they are just different colors of titanium lol."
"Come on, why a Barcelona shirt?"
The end of this video has multiple examples of ‘low key” flexes
Someone help me with the intro and outro music
You just love Apple
"Man, that Barcelona shirt goes hard. Didn't know Marques was into football.
Great video as always."
A 911 is boring and predictable? 😂
Visca Barca
10:13 Haha oh man and here I was feeling throughout that the video quality was actually kinda oddly off
"The best of video, Barcelona's shirt! Yeah!"
Barcelona Jersey? 😃 Who's introducing Marques to football?
"After you said its shot on iPhone, I watched the video again just to focus on the details. Minute 8:44, close up shot on dynamic island features,  how is that finger looking so sharp 😅"
barka
911? What happened to Apolo? Tesla S you have had?
"I had a feeling halfway through that something looked a little off, and I thought to myself ""imagine if Marques revealed at the end that it was shot on an iPhone..."" never have I felt more correct!"
Congrats on the 911
"@1:45 don't call that ""focal lengths"", that's just digital zoom (while using the same sensor). Each sensor has a lens with a fixed focal length which gives the image its ""distinctive"" look. You don't see pro photographers shoot portraits with wide angle lenses because low focal lengths make our faces (and all objects for that matter) look weird and not how our eyes see them. Using digital zoom will not change the ""distortion"" caused by a focal length. I know apple is literally writing the ""focal length"" in the icon but that's just fake.."
Excellent review Marques! Just picked up my 15 pm from an iPhone 12 mostly thanks to your initial reveiw 😊
"big flex...
congratulations"
My thing is I’m always hitting the switch when screenshotting
This feels like a sponsored video
"I don't mean to brag, but I have been watching Marques long enough that about 30s into the video, I was already expecting a ""this entire video was shot on an iPhone"". 
To be fair, I figured it wouldn't be this particular video and maybe some other one in the future, but then that's just a testament to how damn good the camera has become.

Also, congrats on the new ride! Absolutely sick!"
"I knew this was shot on an iPhone, damn its good tho🫣"
Basically a Jerryrigeverything thumbnail
Wallpaper plsssssssa
That Apple keynote ending was chefs kiss
Who watched it twice after learning it was shot on an iPhone? 🤚🏻
Happy birthday!
ive turned my action button to focus mode no more unexpected messages when im with my GF 😪
Barca jersey looks great on you 🙌🏻
"Wish i could like the video again just for the FCB jersey
Gift me one too marques😆"
nice facial hair mr stark.
Shot on iPhone. Knew it was coming. But still got me.
4:19 Am I the only one who uses the action button to show the 8 shortcuts page? You can program your own shortcuts and what order they are in and you just tap the shortcut you want to run
"I made a custom siri shortcut to check in which focus mode I am and customized the action button that way.
So when I'm at home it controls my lights, in the car it starts playing my liked songs on Spotify, opens my speedcam app and asks me if I want to navigate using Google maps.

You can even automatically switch focus modes based on bluetooth connection (in my car) and wifi, at home and at work.

It's great and it's surprisingly fast, like pretty much instant :0   :-)"
Love the Barca jersey ❤️💙
"This video was just to flex his Porsche 911😂
Happy birthday buddy 🎉"
Yes please do more videos like this one and that’s impressive that it was shoot on an IPhone 15 pro
Happy birthday MKBHD 🎉
noticed right away the colours were abit off
Can someone tell me the weather app MKBHD uses in the video please?
First finally for 2023
Europe just forced Apple to convert all their products to USB-C by december 2024.
👋🙂
"big flex at the end, that's so nice Marques....happy birthday"
"Wouldn't have guessed we are the same age lol. Thought you were a bit younger than me. Happy belated and kudos on making a ""the morning after"" iPhone video lol I think the 16 is finally going to make me move from Android for good."
The video on iPhones is unappreciated .
"Called it! but also, great video."
Turbo S🤤🤤
Congrats on the PORSCHEEEEEEEE!!!!
Damm @Marques Brownlee You Look Awesome With Barcerlona Jersy❤❤
The action button with a few Tesla Siri Shortcuts has been really nice for me
"Finally, Marques bought a normal car."
Boo Barca
Why do smartphone cameras always blur other smartphone cameras on video? I've seen this too often.
What about the battery? You forgot the most important aspect of 15 pro😮
I returned mine after 2 weeks. As an Android user I couldn't stand iOS.
sick birthday gift for yourself !!
IPhone 15 three months.... I bought the same phone again.
I was tempted to upgrade several times but I decided to keep my 13 mini. I just love the size of this thing and I still think it takes excellent photos and videos. The a15 chip is still super fast and unless you’re a big mobile gamer you aren’t missing out on much by still having a 13 or even a 12.
Nice shirt!
Absolutely sick car 🔥
Nice
"I liked the video just because of the Jersey, I’m not a Barca fan but still good to see you wearing a football jersey 😂 I don’t know how Americans call it."
insane production quality as per usue.
Flexing about Apple access while you’re flexing your latest sports car while you’re flexing about your iPhone 15 Pro… Thats how rich people flex 💪
Pitty there’s still no under display Touch ID. Wasted marketing tactic if there is none on the 16 pro coming from a 6s
"Fuck, I've been waiting for this video."
Anybody knows whats the weather app name? Search it as the widget name and foind nothing
😂😂😂😂FCB 🤙
Messi is the GOAT.
Holy smokes man. This video was really great. Congrats on the car too!
The last minute of the video was the best minute of the video!
BARCELONA
Why refuse to use a screen protector?
@mkbhd please tell me you’re a Barça Fan? 😁👏
"Regarding the 1-1.5x crop, you are using it, just not consciously.
Sure, you didn’t tap in the 1x button to get a different crop, but zooming by hand between those, will also give you no quality drop.
So it’s basically better quality zoom between 1x-3x."
"Battery consumption has gotten better, especially with Instagram. But I almost wish id waited, as it burned through over 50 battery cycles in the first month from launch. Horrendous QC."
happy birthday!! sweet ride too!
"I also don’t use a phone case, but always use a screen protector. Wonder why MK doesn’t use one."
By looking excess light on your face. I understand it's recorded by the iPhone. 😅 And zoom in and out also another hits. 😊. But good quality 👍🏼
"Fk Tesla, ICEs are where the joy is."
"A porshe 911 is not flashy 👀, I must be in the wrong financial bracket"
Spatial video is only on 15 pro and 15 pro max. Not on 15.
it is football not soccer
"Ah didn’t knew you were a Barca fan 🤦🏻‍♂️, for those who don’t know the jersey, it’s football team like Nokia’s phones 🤣"
Mine still overheates js
"I’ve found the camera to be one of the better uses of the action button as well. A little tip I’d like to recommend to all:

Set the action button to a shortcut, which immediately reads the name of the network your phone is connected to. If the network name matches your Home’s Wi-Fi name, then have it run whatever function you want (I have it set to open my Apple TV remote)

If the Network doesn’t match your home network’s name, then have it run another function (I have it set to open camera).

Now you have an action button that elicits two functions, one for at home, one for away the house."
this comment section is weirding me out a little bit💀 this is the first time i see a bunch of people on a youtube video agreeing that an iPhone is actually pretty damn good without feeling the pressure to hate on it just because apple made it
"the AirPods 5:43 do need an upgrade, especially the case. Can someone inform them please.."
My Porsche app... This could be interesting.
"my man has a 911 gt3 now, im crying."
Who is better Samsung s23 ultra or iPhone 15 pro?
"Daily driving this phone for the past 2 weeks as an upgrade from the 13 base, and it’s been awesome! The camera upgrade is substantial, without making the 13 or older models feel bad, and the battery upgrade has been helpful (albeit not as noticeable as I initially thought). Loving the ProMotion though!"
This is my smartphone of the year 🎉 IPhone 15 pro
Watched it again after that last part
Waw FCB
"One would expect that with tech improvements newer iPhones would have batteries that run longer. If you run the iPhone with settings turned on the way they were intended, battery would need to be charged every 1.5 days. Yes, I know that’s quite okay. But tell that to my dad who just moved from an Android that used to give him a 6 day battery life only because he’s a super light user. Like, he hardly keeps the screen on. But the same practice in his iPhone isn’t giving him even a 2 day battery endurance. Had to turn a lot of things off just to try and improve things a little bit."
Hala Madrid
Barcelona fans like this.
"Please also film the S24 Ultra Review on a S24U, would love to see a comparison"
"nice car dude, great choice"
Hi
Looking forward to the Auto Focus video of your 911.  Is that a turbo S?
Is Marques going broke? Someone save him from the Barcelona grip
Update on the pixel 8…regular one please
Love you from south Africa 😂😂😂😂😂❤❤❤❤❤
You pulled a scary fast on us
"Apple paid him good money , to hide the battery issue."
oof need the BTS on this like Apple did @Studio lets make it happen !
"Still rocking my 11 Pro Max since launch day and I still can’t justify the 15 Pro Max as enough of an upgrade. I don’t like the Titanium as much as the Stainless, I love the shiny rails on my phone. I don’t care about USB because my AirPod Pro 2’s that are only a year old and not going to be upgraded for a good while are Lightening so would now need an extra cable unless Qi charging is available where I’m going (and would need a charger). Action button seems a gimmick tbh, no need to upgrade for that. I dunno, maybe I’m getting old at 30 but I’m cool for maybe even a fifth full year with this phone. Unless the 16 series phones really move the game on. It’s been said we seem to be at peek iPhone now and I think that’s true. If my phone died tomorrow I’d try and find a 14 Pro Max before I bought a 15."
Bro pulled an apple move at the end😂😂😂
Happy 30th Brother🎉
Why did apple go so hard with the action button menu graphics?
Barcelona ha 😅
"iPhone 15 Pro camera is so far the best Camera to get in a portable device
 as it stands now, perfect for shooting videos."
"MY 2023 list : 

1. Huawei mate x5 foldable 1 tb  simply brilliant it has absolutely everything devoid of nothing 

2. My glorious incredible Samsung s23 ultra most fun phone ive ever owned

3. ONE PLUS OPEN good hinge

4. XIAOMI MIX FOLD 3 excellent design 


5. PIXEL 8 PRO  impressive AI 

6. Iphone 15 pro max 1 tb great video and excellent clean  implementation of their AI voice accessibility feature 

The Huawei mate x5 fold is phenomenal. It has micro SD card, every camera is incredible,  3 to 5 day battery,  stylus pen works every screen ,  big front screen,  emergency satellite crash etc it's amazing and I'm a big Samsung fan

The iphone 15 pro max is my favorite iPhone but it can't compare to any of those androids with its limitations and many of those features like programmable side key and USB C Samsung has had for years"
"Holy shit shat footage looked amazing🤯 I didn’t even think that it could be Iphone footage, but well done to apple👏"
"Great review as always! 2 things. First, congrats on the Turbo. I’m a Porsche fan (986 550 Spyder) so seeing you buy one is quite cool. Second, never would have expected this was shot on the 15 Pro. That was surprising as I was not expecting it to look similar to what I have been seeing (given me watching it on a 3rd gen iPad Air), so that’s great news on the video side. Also nice to hear they fixed or improved what worried me on the 15 Pro with overheating and such.

Enjoy both the 15 Pro and the Turbo! Keep up the amazing videos as always."
Can we talk about the Barcelona Jersey?
"« This entire video, every single shot was shot on an iPhone 15 pro » 🤯🤯🤯🤯"
"Great Review but, The UI still fits the real Apple of Steve Jobs' time, but not the style Philosophie of the the Tim Cook area. But it's not unapple like."
I upgraded to 15 pro yesterday from pixel 6!!
Anyone use the action button to start their car climate??
Whats the name of the intro track??
Happy birthday Marques!! Love the 911
"Knowing that you only film in RED,  i could not tell the difference on my 1440p OLED monitor. Everything looked crisp and MKBHD level quality. I think a new generation of filmmakers will take advantage of iPhones with USB-C moving forward, especially Pros."
Little apple twist at the end. like that one
75k in 20 minutes is insane. People really do value good insights!
youre my role model maq
Man that ending was brilliant. I feel like I should know by now!!
I think your iphone 15 pro shot looks better than apple's event shots :)
weather widget  link please. 🙃
"Hit us with the 'shot on iPhone' at the end haha nice, and congrats on the 911!"
I could tell
GOAT
I thought you were 24
Just Love watching Marques wear the Barça Shirt. Visca Barça. ❤💙
if somebody told me this was the iphone 12 i probably wouldn't disagree
Wear a Manchester united jersey next time 😢
Not you in that jersey… 😭
WHY BARCELONAAAAAAA💔💔💔
Televendita Apple
Apple never misses in the video camera department
Congrats on the 911🥳🥳
The views are crazy 🤪
What happened to the blind camera test video?
It has been a long time since I've been *this* impressed by an iPhone camera. My jaw dropped when you said the whole video was shot on an iPhone. It looks absolutely gorgeous.
Bro that 911 🥵
I still cannot give up the AI and automation features that come with the Pixel 7 pro
That Porsche 911 segue was so cleannnnnn
Visca Barca!
@Marques Brownlee forgot to mention about battery
"I have the iPhone 14 Pro and it has poor battery life, screen scrolling problem and other bugs. Should I trade in to the the 15 Pro or the 15 Pro Max or wait for the 16 Pro?"
Sitting here watching on my iPhone 8 🤙🏼
"I was about to like this review, when I saw this Barca jersey. 
Sorry, I can't...🥲"
"Awesome phone, but beautiful car 🥵"
so this here is my titanium iPhone 15 pro
"4:27 
What about swiping the screen to the left ? 
Isn’t that faster ?"
using the the action button as a flashlight is really useful in dark places or at night
"Great review, nice Barca shirt too"
Ain’t no freaking way it was shot on an iPhone!!! Literally would not have noticed if you didn’t say anything smh
"Si is it worth it if you come from an iPhone 13 Pro Max?. I wanna buy the 15 pro(not max) because I wanted it to be smaller and lighter, but my sierra blue is gorgeous and I find the new colors kinda dull."
BARCA BARCA BARCA BARCA BARCA!!!!❤ 💙
i was wondering why didn't you go the with the pro max
iOS is a top notch
"I would to say that I am just loving 🥰 iPhone 15 pro max, as always max user 

Hit like if you have Pro Max always"
"Literally just finished every 15 pro review cuz im considering getting one- literally just finished the last 20 minute one; reload the YouTube Home Screen, andddddd 😂"
Barcelona Jersey staying strong
You rocking My team’s shirt Fc Barcelona 😍😍
I've always wanted an M3 so for my 30th birthday I test drove one 😐
Amazing
"love how you can instantly tell from the highlight rolloff and bokeh that they will go for the ""btw this whole video was shot on the Iphone 15. could you tell"" reveal"
"Damn, the video looked really good! Saying it was shot entirely on the iPhone 15 Pro is about to make even more Android users switch 🤭😁"
"Wohhh!!!!! 2 Flex in one video.. amazing especially the 2nd one... congrats on the 911😍 u deserve it!! 
btw HUUUGGEEEEE fan"
The podcast family was ready.
Cool!✌️
"There is no contet to create to repeat iphone 15pro review
Apple fan baby"
"Wearing a football shirt, i didn’t see that coming"
@mkbhd 10:12 Wait! What? So now I have to rewatch it again 😫
Spatial videos can also work on Oculus!
Aubameyang
bro is cooking with barlecona shirt!
Marques you need to do a video on 65square!!
barca shirt marques? cmon u can do better (madrid!)
"Nice review bro, from the Z fold 5 user 😅"
"A barca jersey again today Marques, I'm starting to sense some kinda pattern here, is there something you'd like to admit to everyone... hmmm ..😊"
first
Thats a dream car.
Congrats on ur Porsche :) well deserved!
How about the battery?
Congratulations on the 911!
behind the scenes of how this was shot with iphone?
HALA MADRID
"Haha, I called it on the Porsche! Congrats🎉"
Anyone notice the polestar pickup new car??
Brooo hate the jersey! HALA MADRID!
"One of the best long term reviews 
Period"
Love longer term reviews.  You get to see them after the bugs are fixed and it more represents what we as the users experience.
I certainly felt the quality difference and wanted to comment what's wrong with the video. Seems a bit over processed. Well we got the answer
"yes, i use my iphone 15 pro without a case, it feels and looks nice 😁"
"was that a low key flex? I love it! ""There is no substitute"""
Why is there a scratch?
"The phone is good in general but it gets a bit warm when browsing social media for a while or recording video, also it gets a bit hot when charging"
"just got my 15 pro max 3 hours ago,i love it"
This video will sell a lot of iPhones...
Was speculating why face shots look different but then got clarification at the end
Anyone know what model of 911 that is ?
Love the Barcelona jersey 😏
Hopefully in the future we will see a Manchester United jersey
I'd like to see an Auto Focus of your new car!
Classy tale end
"the pro models are overkill for most people and this only gets more true every year (as the practical gap between those and the standard iphones shrinks) but yeah if you have a 12 or 11 or older now is a great time to upgrade, i’ve been loving my 15 for the few weeks i’ve had it. especially the dynamic island it’s super fun"
"tbh when the vid started i was like wtf is wrong with the background this time, nd at last when he said it was shot on iphone 15 i was like make sense"
"i actually just switched from my S21 to the 15 pro (first time running an apple phone as my  daily) i was just getting so unlucky with software problems on my last 2 samsung phones (last straw was having to do a full factory reset due to an One Ui update corrupting my phone. I like it so far, no weird hiccups just need to get use to it"
W camera quality😮
"Posted less than 30 minutes ago, and already at 70k views. You da man, MKHD!"
You're cheating by having used the natural Color one imho
"I did end up using the 1x/1.2x/1.5x feature, mostly as easy, repeatable zoom levels below 2x."
"Marques buys a new matt black Porsche 911 - “It is not flashy. It’s not dramatic. It’s boring” 

*cries in poor*"
Love my 15 Pro now that they fixed the heating issue.
w vid! It would be cool if you do this with the pixel fold.
"oop, I ruined the surprise of this being shot on the iPhone by coming into the comments way too early 🥲"
I wouldn’t call a Porsche 911 boring…
Never knew that you are a Barcelona fan
Epic
"Hey Marques :D I upgraded from a OnePlus 5T to this exact phone and color.
I have the button mapped to focus mode.
I love the longer term reviews, thanks for sharing this one!
It's awesome that this was shot on the iPhone 15 Pro as well."
Congratulations on the swanky new Beetle dude 🎉🎉
"Unpopular opinion, the Journal app is good. I activate my microphone speech to text and dictate entries, its nice that you have the option to take photos directly to the Journal which do not appear in Camera Roll. FaceID security allows you to keep more than you would in your Notes app."
"Didn't you have 20M subscribers at one point? You only have 18M subscribers now, which is bizarre."
"I can't wait for 2024, I'll be waiting for the iphone 16 pro max as my first iphone device😊"
"Great video! I have 15 Pro in natural titanium since launch and it's really good phone, upgraded from my XS Max and it's definitely an upgrade, the cameras, crazy good night mode, so good cinematic video, USB C mostly now using with HDMI when traveling, even Dynamic Island with silky smooth animations getting me all day battery with 80% charge limit.. I love it."
You are 30 years old now?  Wow.  Happy Belated Birthday Marques!!
"Looking forward to buy the iPhone 15 Pro Max, not sure about the 911..."
Nice flex at the end. The device you used to shoot this entire video is the best phone for video content creators. No contest.
"Damn, was not expecting this whole video to be shot on the iphone 15 pro. Wow"
911 for your 30th 🔥🔥🔥
Congrats on the 911 marques can’t wait for the video
The Barcelona top just breaks my heart..
"4 minutes into watching this on my 13"" MacBook Air and I'm realizing this was shot on a phone, presumably an iPhone. Biggest giveaway is skin texture and the focus masking, specifically around Marques' hair. I think if it were softened in post and if the blur effect weren't used, I wouldn't have been able to tell. Very cool stuff, but I'd still rather use a point and shoot camera over a phone."
Porsche 🤢
Rocking Barca KIT>>>>>>>
what's the name of that weather app?
Apple needs to make an action camera.
Shoot in iPhone 🙄🙄😮‍💨😮‍💨
I own a 15 pro and I didn’t know that this camera is capable of shooting the video I just saw.
Wrong football team choose
A video for a car announcement!
"I turned my action button into a new home button.

But I never use it so…🤷🏻‍♂️"
Congrats on the turbo!
"I am a lefty, for me the action button is exactly at the right spot."
Already 3 months damn Time is flying anyway happy new year guys
No wonder the video looked a bit odd
It is wierd seeing an american to wear a football/soccer jersey.
Richy Rich....
that jersey looks nice
How do poeple manage to scratch their screens? I have never had a scratch on my screen. I do not even understand what do you do with your phone to scratch a glass screen???
"That end shocked me, did not realize how good the video is"
"Holy shit, the plot twist at the end. It actually looks amazing."
"Wait, is it a Pro or Pro Max model that you have? I'm confused."
"Marques you should support Real Madrid, not barCelno.
Madrid is so clear ✔️"
i am running iphone 12 with no case for 3rd year.. is still fast and in good shape.. battery is just in bad condition.. i better replace battery end use it for more 2-3 years.. it is true green and also budget friendly thinking..
Lighting is why I went with MX keys mouse combo because the apple variants suck and have way less features and still lightning….Logitech apple accessories are the move. Don’t even get me started on the apple mouse.
911 video? 👀
Which one would you recommend for students IPhone 15 pro or Samsung s23 ultra or wait for s24ultra???
Take off that Jersey 😂
"Ah, so that's why Marques was looking orange through the whole video. the quality is impressive and most wouldn't notice it's taken on a phone if they weren't looking"
Bro is definitely in love love with 🍎
He clearly have Vision Pro for tests already :)
What is the weather app?
First
How much fun to buy a phone worth 1500$ 😂😂😂😂😂
"I like how he said ""FLEX"" LOL 🤣 Love this guy!"
"I did feel something was off, the exposure on the intro shot of Marques was off to say the least and there was a noticeable noise in certain shots"
Shoutout to MKBHD for having the most expensive plant light ever 😂
"Happy birthday, Marques!"
Bought 15 pro yesterday
Samsung clears
Finally someone agrees that titanium looks better than stainless steel!
Cool to see you rocking Barcelona jersey!
"Sidenote: Marques mentioned using ChatGPT to do “complex math”. This is a bad idea. ChatGPT gives the appearance of being able to do complex math, but often gives wrong answers. Do not use it for anything important without double-checking the answers it gives you."
Barça… great taste
"The next video with the Real Madrid shirt, please 😂😂😂"
"it's so obvious this video was shot on a phone. I used to think YouTubers spending so much money on cameras was a kind of waste of money, but it makes sense now."
Lovely review
"I switched to iPhone from being an Android user for fifteen years.  My 15 Pro Max is hands down the nicest device I've ever owned.  The only drawback or thing that I am struggling to adjust to is the keyboard situation.  The predictive text with SwiftKey on Android just seems way better.  And there's no ""swipe left to delete"" feature on SwiftKey on iOS"
"Can we just appreciate that Marques reviewed the smaller phone and not the Max?

I swear everyone forgot that people like the 6.1 inch screen phones."
"This ""Shot on Iphone"" ad is better than what apple did with their event 🤣"
Great video and I appreciate the jersey 
I like the beard 👍
Epic Plot Twist (Even though we were told earlier that it was coming)
"In the first 20 seconds I thought ""amazing quality - as always"". At the end I was even more amazed."
Wow ❤nice 👍🏻
"The spacial video recording on the iPhone will make things make look very huge, when viewing it on the headset, because the cams are so close to each other on the iPhone. Actually left and right cam need to have the same distance like your eyes to not feel like a fly when watching your records."
Who agrees MKBHD is the GOAT?
Bruhs flexing his 911😭😭😭
Please use your platform and influence to help bring mainstream attention to the ongoing ethnic cleansing and genocides happening around the world. Gaza. Congo. These are both tied to big tech companies and their investors.
"Hey Marques, I didn’t know that Mia had left the adult industry and now works in your office!😂

*That joke will only be understood by the scholars!😎"
"In order to record Spatial Videos, upcoming non-pro iPhone models will ship with iPhone 11/12 camera alignment 😆😂"
Was not expecting you to be wearing a Barcelona jersey
"Thanks for the update.  My daughter just got the 15 and loves it.  Had the 8 before, so big update.  I have the 12 Mini and looking at the 15 pro, but might hold off.  My Apple products are getting older but still hoping for a 27"" iMac with apple chips.  Thanks for all the great content in 2023.  Happy New Year!"
VISÇA BARÇA!! 😍😍
FCB🥰
on my s10e i have the bixby button bound to system media play/pause
no screen protector caseless gang where you at?!?!?
"This looks sooo good. I saw the tweet before watching, so I was nitpicking, but still looks clean AF. 

In terms of the phone, I relate to most of these points. Still use this phone as I did with the iPhone 12 Pro🙃 I also understand why Apple is not putting the ProMotion display on the normal phone, hardly notice it."
"That Porsche looks fire🔥, plz make an indepth video about it."
"Glad to see the iPhone held up ok! Iv been using 15 pro max for about 2 weeks now now, great video from the best team!"
Wallpaper?
FC Barcelona fan??🔥
How were you filming the iPhone if it was filmed on the iPhone.
"7:17 iPhone 11 and 12 camera are also horizontally aligned, can they do that?"
Seeing you with a barça shirt makes me want to send you a Panama team shirt
Bro it's 1:45am here 😴
woah that locksscreen is a real throwback!! if you know you know
Nice beard
Visca Braca 😂
"I hope you guys don't miss the last part, damn I didn't notice at all 😂"
Wouldn't expect anything different from an apple fannyboy
Get the s23 ultra. better phone. ifykyk
"""flex, i know"""
I’m glad there weren’t too many brags in this review.
"it wasn't too disturbing, but I could tell the shots were over sharpened"
iPhone 14 Pro Max is better than iPhone 15 Plus thoughts?
I wonder what the iPhone 16 will look like
"I share the same sentiments on the 15 Pro Max! Now, when is a video of the 911 coming? I am curious about the practicality of those center lock wheels"
Thanks for the review! Just got mine iPhone 15 Pro 🙌👀 Great video as always 🔥 Please more longer term reviews! 💯 Congrats on the new car! 🥳
that shot on iphone 15 pro part got me
Awesome information
I believe Apple are using an old standard format for the 3D videos. Maybe VLC and a 3D television might work for watching them too?
Anyone know the name of the weather app he’s using at 6:26?
Happy Birthday Marques!🎉
Congratulations on your new toy👍 wish you more to come this year
Shot on iPhone 15 pro whaaaat?🤩🤩🤩
That shirt 😍😍😍
A barca shirt ❤
The end 🎉🎉🎉🎉
The quality of your content is incredible. I nearly screamed at that last shot with the Porsche in the background. Congratulations! and what a reveal. Looking forward to the auto focus episodes.
Wallpaper please?
porsche 911 turbo review?
What's the name of that weather app / widget ?
"Holy shit, didn't think the video was shot on iPhone, it looked just normal!
Was the audio also recorded on iPhone?"
"Love the Barcelona jersey, are you a Barca fan?"
Barcelona love in air
I couldn't even tell that it was shot on a smartphone. iPhones (and phones in general) have come a long way!
"I cannot watch this, I will regret my decision"
"Don't get me wrong. It was a good video, but what was the point? Did we actually learn something? Having said that, I think I speak for everybody when I say we could use a lot a lot more 3 months later reviews. Plus there are a lot more devices out there other than galaxies pixels and iPhones. Would be nice to see those too, but that's not up to me"
7:14 iPhone 15 Pro or 15 Pro Max* correction
"I love your videos, Marques but Hala Madrid!"
Barcelona ❤
I tend to use the flashlight a lot… so mapping the action button to that has been very nice.
"Literally I *JUST* got a sweet new Natural Titanium 15 Pro, so this video is very well timed! Good on you!"
Nice flex at the end there! Congrats on 30 and the car!
Hala Madrid
Dont read the comments yet! Watch the whole video first.
FC Barcelona😊❤
happy birthday
Visca Barca!💙❤
First
"Wow! Appreciate the quality, the performance, the journey, great video! Happy birthday & congrats on your new Porsche! 🎉"
Damn…that twist at the end was unexpected to me! Didn’t realize all the B-roll shots were even done on the iPhone! Video is phenomenal on that phone sheesh.
Final flex was just🔥
Spatial video 😂😂 apple is a joke
Força Barça!! ❤️💙
"I genuinely thought you were using your normal camera, and could barely even tell the difference after you told us! I'm even more jealous of people with iphone 15 pros 🤣(I have an iphone 13 mini)"
Didn't peg you as a futbol fan. 😮
"Do a durability test. Maybe a scratch test, put it in a small box full of keys and shake it around to simulate months of it being in your pocket?"
"Ok sorry I'm (CURRENTLY) android like really old phone Huawei p30 pro, and the fact that the whole video was shot on iphone is ridiculous."
I did not even notice that this was also shot on the 15 pro! usually I'm very perseptive of changes in video quality but I didn't notice it at all.
Review idea makes sense for other phones. Iphones been the same for 5 years....
"I'm actually thinking of upgrading to the 15 pro series from a midrange android device, but am confused between the pro and the pro max ... What should I prefer?? I have mixed usage with more days having heavy usage and camera. I don't game much on my phone tho"
These are the kind of reviews I look for before buying a product
"The iPhone 15/15 Pro is really cool, but I've been considering upgrading to the Pixel 8. Since that's been your main daily phone, would it be possible to make a broken in review on that phone as well?"
"A long term review is 1-2 years. I know u even say it, but yeah. 3 months is still brand new imo. And yes, saying u have normal wear and tear is not a “long term review” that’s just any product ever. This is just eating up video real estate in the niche “long term review” subject by a lot of smaller youtube channels, but by someone with basically no long term experience with any phone the last decade. I don’t really take any reviews here that seriously cause MKBHD rarely goes that deep beyond basic design changes and BASIC software stuff. There’s always a reality to the product that he doesn’t go over well because he doesn’t use them more than a week or two. I feel he has very pretty reviews, but very empty feeling at the end of day, like he doesn’t want to be too harsh so he gets brand deals and close with the big companies."
Every shot on a 15 pro?? Is that including A-Roll?? That is wildly impressive!
You got me at “(wears FCB jersey)”
Yup upgrading from an iPhone XR to iPhone 15 Pro Max 😍 and also I’m happy with the USB C since my iPhone 15 Pro Max and my Google Pixel 6a can be charged into one charging cable and not bringing extra cable for my lightning iPhone 😅
I never knew 1x x 3 existed as a feature. You let your team have their pets at work 6:14 ..? Pet friendly work place I like
"The entire video shoots on iphone  will approach your red  club, awesome quality!"
My 15 pro max has been overheating out of nowhere most days
"Using an anamorphic lens, eh?"
Battery life is dreadful
I wen't from Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra to iPhone 15 Pro (titan) and I'm happy so far I wanted smaller form factor and since the USB C I can transfer photos and vidoes to my PC faster it's really nice time to change ecosystems I think
Hey What’s Up! MKBHD Is Here
never been this early
Happy belated birthday 🎉
the best in the game
Though i am a madrid fan but i was happy seeing you even in a barca t shirt since it means that the craze of football is finally increasing in the usa.
"S23 doesn't have a single review video. 
iPhone 15 Pro gets a 2nd review video.
That's Marques for you."
the fact that his iphone isnt midnight black to match the new porsche is a crime
Happy belated birthday Marques 🎉
"I tried the 15 pro max and could not deal with how big the screen scale was. Even moving everything to as low as it could go, everything was too big on the screen"
Bro why Barcelona Jersey
"I'm looking to upgrade maybe in April/May time, but does anyone think it might be worth waiting for the 16 in September instead? Like does anyone have any predictions that Apple are going to do anything major to the next iteration?"
"I almost want to dislike the video just cuz, Marques is wearing a Barcá jersey and being a Madrista, kinda sad that Marques is settling for less 😢"
That’s cool and everything but it would it looked better with a Real Madrid jersey
Is iphone more suited to left handers?
7:14 spatial video recording is not supported on the regular iPhone 15 or 15 plus it is only supported on the 15 pro or pro max
How can you miss the BATTERY ? 15 pro has literally the tiniest battery ever. I have to recharge my phone twice a day :(
"Congrats on the 911. I’ve been watching for years and years, & you panning up gave me goose bumps. Keep striving."
Mkbhd finally made an iphone review shot on iPhone 🗿🗿🗿🗿💀💀💀💀 and am i the only one who noticed it ???
why the barça shirt?
i was just thinking about the action button placement the other day. would be nice to have it under the power button to reachability.
What a flex I have to wait one more year before I buy my Porsche
First
"Use me as the ""MKBHD Forever"" like button. 🙌🏼"
When you have to watch the video again because he said it was all shot on an iPhone 15 Pro 🧠
Beautiful car but missed out on the chance on having red rims
Nice comparison! And happy birthday!
No way it was ALL recorded on the iPhone itself
Visca el Barça i visca Catalunya 🍾
Barcà 🎉🎉🎉🎉
pro or pro MAX? I want that zoom and battery life but my small hands will not agree 😢
Wait a Porsche 911 isn’t flashy but boring? What planet are you on 😂
The fact that this whole video was shot on an iphone
NO
Around 5:30 does anyone else notice desync with audio and video?
"""shoot on an iPhone 15 Pro"" yeah gg didn't see that coming 😭(and I love those reviews that come later in the year, we want more!)"
I am afraid of dropping it without the case 💀
"You say the overheating issue is solved. But have you gone into an Apple Store and tried touching the iPhone 15s vs the 15 pros? ALL the pros were baking hot, whereas the regular ones were fine."
"I went from the iPhone 12 to the iPhone 15 Pro Max, and I must say I feel like I’m getting the absolute most out of IOS and the newest technologies"
Barça! 
What I’m thinking of buying the 15 since seeing your review- Do you recommend a clean setup ? Or transfer everything over / please help your input is needed
Just didn't expect that it was shot on the iphone 15 pro
Marquess wearing an Barcelona jersey. Did I miss something
"Barcelona shirt 🤔 
Anything about that?"
YOO Congrats on the 911 Turbo. At this rate you might become more of a car guy than a tech guy!
"If you're reading, its too late"
"YOU'RE WELCOME. 

Kind regards,
Europe"
"love how you shot this whole thing with the iphone 15 camera. so many people underestimate these cameras on a daily basis. you dont need a $5,000 camera to film professionally, point proven MKBHD. ty"
TL;DR: it’s overall good.
Now I have to rewatch the video to nitpick cause apparently it’s shot on a phone 😂😅
No wonder the iPhone every year  stay the king of videos. The quality of the video from the iPhone keep getting better and better. The iPhone is like a Toyota and Ima leave it at that. Great video. Great review. Thank you for such an amazing 2023!
Happy Birthday!
Great video! Where can I purchase that backpack (shown towards the end of this vid)?
¡VISCA EL BARÇA!
The action button needs double click capabilities as well as the hold.
Flex x 2
Imagine buying a $3500 headset just to browse your photos. It’s so stupid
Barcelona shirt :( unsuscribing.....
"Well I’ll be darn, Happy recent birthday Mr. Marques!"
Who else noticed that he is wearing a Football jersey 😅
How was the battery?😢
And the gent wearing a Baca shirt😳
"Super dope car, congrats Marques."
You have a point on not having to upgrade every year as I’ve had my 11 Pro Max since 2019 and it’s still going strong but I’m itching for an upgrade
happy bday and beautiful car
What is the name is weather app he was using does any one know?
"got an iphone 15 pro this year after having an 11 for nearly 4 years, can say its a significant, but comfortable, and familiar change with very worth while perks"
I'm on the iPhone 12. Is the 15 non 'Pro' even an upgrade? Is it worth the upgrade or should I wait until 120hz or something... 😅
Repping Barca ❤
omg he did the thing
Wallpaper link?
"911 flex, dope."
I am disappointed to see Marques in a Barca jersey!
"Okay, impressive that the entire video was shot on the iPhone itself. 

Wouldn't have guessed it tbh."
AirPods Max 2 in the background 😂 6:13
I got a iPhone 15 and I’ve loved it great review 😊
"would've been so funny if you just put a ""this video was filmed on iPhone 15"" at the end like the Apple keynote earlier"
Welcome to the 30s club ❤
Didn’t see the last dialogue coming ❤️ !!
"7:15 wait, iPhone 15 can record with spatial video?"
The amount of subtle flexes in this video is amazing
100th to comment
"this is the earliest I've come on Marques' video at ten minutes, and I just wanna take this opportunity to express my feelings about deadmau5 and better yet, how it feels to have your fav youtuber like the same music"
Please do these for Google Pixel as all the different models (4 of them)  I've purchased over the years were all very short-lived and had h/w issues pop-up very soon. I use my devices very carefully but still they were poor from a build quality/hw perspective.
Marques with the Barcellona Shirt is the best thing I’ve seen today!
It warms my heart to know Marquez is Cules. Visca Barça❤💙
"Sorry Marques, this has to be one of the most disappointing days for me 😳. How can you wear an FC Barcelona shirt??? 😓"
New doggo at 6:15?
Crazy how i didn’t even notice it was shot on an iphone
"My Guy, Shot Video Like Apple."
"7:16 spatial video recording is actually only available on 15 Pro + 15 Pro Max (not on the 15 normal, because it has diagonal cameras)"
Congratulations on the 992 Turbo S! Suits the matte black really well.
VIVA BARÇA ❤️💙
"OK, now do the Porsche rew."
"""Thank you Europe""! Yes! It was not said enough!!"
I think he's going to do a drop test when he stands in front of the stairs
"Wouldn’t have thought this was shot on the iPhone, huge props!
Also happy birthday, and congrats on the new ride! 😁"
Bro put a 911 in his video as a tax write off
Congrats on your 911. I would hope you’re not calling that car boring. 😅
Forca Barcaaaa
"You can get the IPhone 15 Pro Max in Russia for around $2000US, Though it`s an import from Japan, At least the one i seen in a video."
Is this the time for tech content to be posted? Linus posted at like the same time.
throwback to that first wallpaper!
New record for me 10 mins 😀
"Best phone I’ve ever had especially moving from the 13 pro max. Ik I’ll hold on to this 4L, my favorite colour being the blue titanium especially, perfect."
This years' pro iphones are worth buying than before.
"U GOT THE PORSCHE
That was a sick reveal. Nothing flashy but the lead up to it from a tech and car guy perspective"
"You're the guy bro, always on the point and honest reviews."
everything shot on iphone 15 pro - very impressive and something i didnt expect!
iPhone 15 Pro Smartphone of the year for me
"That is a mega flex, the matte black 911 looks absolutely stunning."
Congrats on the Porsche 911!! Just got a 15 Pro Max and I’m loving it. Need to see some videos of what you think about your car
Action button is very badly positioned. I can’t reach it 😑
FCB🔥🔥🔥
They said they were gonna do it and they did 😂
6:14 such a cute doggo :D
Excited about s24 ultra !!!!
What a flex at the end
I like how this whole video was made just to flex he got a Porsche
Mkbhd is barca ❤️💙
You filmed this with an iPhone. I see what you did there. ;)
The Barca shirt actually threw me off 😂😂
"If your reading this, i was not first."
"Really appreciate the iPhone 15 Pro review, I actually upgraded from my iPhone 8 to the 15 Pro. And I must say I am impressed with all the camera advancements, the action button and the Dynamic Island"
What about people who have Android phones? Is it worth upgrading/jumping to Apple on this one?
"Makes little sense to go caseless nowadays. You get a better grip, much stronger MagSafe magnets and of course peace of mind and drop protection."
Bro the ending just hit that’s crazy
"Dear Apple, 
Please make the action button could be mapped with focus mode. 

For work- calander or email
For family time - camera 
Travelling- maps or music 
Workout- music 
Chill- Netflix!! 

Just let me choose!!"
i still use a iphone 7
"I'm sad to see you keeping Wix as a sponsor for the podcast when they are funding a genocide. When you spoke against racism after Georg Floyd, I expected you also to take a stance against genocide, but seeing as you not only stay silent but also accept money from occopying forces, I have decided to unsub. There's no liberation for all when there's no liberation for Palestinians."
Shoutout the Barca kit Marques has on 👀💙❤️
Barcelona 🤨
And hey what about Google pixel 8 series
Marquez es Culé! Visça BARÇA!
First
"Like this so ""I liked my own comment"" isn't at the top"
"Everybody talking about the phone and I am like: ""this dude follows football and has a Barcelona jersey?"""
HALA Madrid 😇
That Barca shirt 🔥👌
Ur special
Not a flex but I knew you shot this on an iPhone xD
Barca drip. Ew
"I’ve loved my 15 pro but damn, this screen scratches like crazy. I don’t baby my phone but I’m careful with it, and I have countless deep scratches and micro scratches all over the screen. Glad I bought Apple Care"
"Just bought my 15 pro max yesterday but I feel like I’ve had it since the very release thanks to your videos !! Greetings from Medellin, col !!"
*This series never gets old. the effort they put into these is amazing. Thanks to Logan and the crew* 1:17
Kinda weird watching you wear a Barcelona tshirt
Im also on the no-case team!
Let's appreciate the hard work she puts into these videos for our entertainment ❤
Why wouldn‘t you put on a screen protector? Worst case you notice it when your finger glides over the edge. And for me at least my finger glide better over the protector than the actual screen. So it‘s protecting my screen AND gets me a better experience. So… wtf?
"The video dropped like 3 min ago and everyone's writing.. a great review, awesome review..  

Guys chill watch the whole video and then write your comment. Yes, we all know that it'll be great, everything will be on point and nicely done. It's the professional we are watching 👑"

"Everyone's talking about the video, but can we take a moment to appreciate how the pause button gives us perfect timing every time?"
FC Barcelona 😊
are you a barca fan?
yo didn't know you like Barcelona
"I don't know some clips in this video are filmed with the iphone 15 pro 
I think"
The only thing I appreciate about iphones is their small size❤
What about battery?
Més que un Club!! ❤💙
Barcelona fan ?
I’m still on a 12 pro max. Not feeling the need to upgrade to anything just yet 😕
why did you stop posting reviews on xiaomi phone too?
So I'm looking forward to your pixel 8 Pro 3 month review 🙂
Freaking YouTube adds brings the mood down before watching the video
The Pro iPhones is definitely my pick and favorite iPhone. I love the iPhone 15 Pro ❤
"You forgot to talk about the Shortcuts menu on the Action Button, this is the real deal!"
representing blaugrana 🔵🔴
Are you a Barcelona fan?
"Damn, when he dropped the ""Btw, this was shot on an iPhone"" my jaw dropped. Haven't noticed a thing!

Also, love the Matte Black 911! Is it a Turbo S?"
Bought this phone for my son and he has been enjoying it.
We've reached peak smartphone with the iPhone 15 Pro.
spanish bro :) tku
Waiting for the pixel 8 pro update update lol 😅
I recognized in 1st sec that it was shot on iphone
"Very camera shot with him standing on the steps my brain is screaming: “Put a case in that!”😂😂😂
Psssst…. LOVE the shirt!"
iOS is boring.
I wish they had 60 fps on Spatial Video though.

Biggest problem with the iPhone... It's made by Apple. If only they were smart enough to release an Android version of their phone.
TIL my iPhone 15 Pro has multiple focal lengths.
Firt time I watch the review and the phone on my hand
Nice shirt
Like my comment for no reason
Is it normal to comment before finishing the video bc it is that good
"W barca Jersey. Marques, you a Barca fan or you thought the Jersey looked cool? 👀"
Marques is culer 🔵🔴
Review OnePlus 12 Please
Fire
Weird shirt
"How 'sharp' your face looked at the beginning made me go 🤔, then ofcourse the ending confirmation/comment made me go YUP!"
Barcelona
Barsa 😵‍💫
"(Edit) Spoiler Alert!!!: 



Damn, I’m surprised this was shot on an iPhone 15 Pro. It looks like it came out of a standard DSLR camera. Apple truly runs the video recording game."
The Apple logo on the back panel is where it got first scratch
صلو على الحبيب المصطفى ❤
pffffffffffffffff this guy is such a bore
No cracks? Amazing.
What's wrong with the quality of the vid? It's not crispy as usual and lack dynamic range on my end 😐😐
W shirt
Thank's for doing these types of reviews!
I always mistake the action button for the volume up button so I’m always wondering why my music isn’t getting louder 😆
something about seeing Marques wearing a barca kit makes me happy
"""My refusal to use screen protector."" That's rich."
Can't believe why people are so obsessed with iphones. $200 Samsung does the job.❤
MKBHD is the best tech creator of all time
If you're reading this then I'm not the last.
"as somebody who uses their phone for youtube/music a lot, i assigned my action button to play/pause. it’s quite convenient when my hands are full and i can’t get to my airpods"
i keep mine on the flashlight
"Guess Americans finally ""discovered"" football"
Barcelona shirt😢😢
Like for Barcelona!🔵🔴
iPhone 15 Pro and TechImma1st
Yeah we would like you so more long term reviews for smartphones and maybe other tech
The comment section is full of bots...damn!
never heard of the dynamic island swiping tip!
You need to do a rig everything
What a sick aka cool video
"The 15 pro is my first iphone, switched after 8 years of android. And …… I dont think i’ll be going back to android 😂 Its been an amazing experience for the 6 weeks that i have used it and I absolutely love it!"
Noti squad
I think this video is shot on iPhone 15 Pro
"barca shirt, pathetic"
"2160 gang, what's up guys"
Barca jersey 🤮🤮🤮🤮
FC Barcelona fans let's gather 
You know the dog asked bro “ do they look good?” after the picture 😂
"just bought one today, so hopefully he likes it"
Loving the jersey!! You a Barca fan?
The best phone on the planet by far. Period. No lagroid comes half close❤
Marques flexing his Porsche 911
Is this video shot on iPhone ?
I’m the first 6 minute person
disappointed in u being a Barca fan
From Somalia 🇸🇴
Just got the 15 pro max and upgraded from 12 pro max and totally worth it.
Since when you’re a barclona fan??🤔🤔
Barcelona?
The phone is great...but I couldn't yet feel the need of upgrading from my iPhone 14 Pro Max. About the Action Button maybe I would go for triggering something with Google Home. Please do more of these type of videos!
Let chill at Spotify Camp Nou together! Fc Barcelona for life
Marques es cule ❤💙
13k views in 4 minutes is insane
Anyone know the name of the weather app? Thanks in advance
Just on time 👌🏽 Let’s see if the upgrade from last year is worth it…
Hi I enjoy your videos I tell my tech friends to watch your videos if they want to know what best about tech everything 🙌🏽✌🏽
"My 15 pro has been great, no breaking issues 😂"
BARCELONA FC AHUEVO
Thanks for the video! The 15 is definitely a jump from the 14 when it comes to UI change
I never knew Marques was a Barça fan
"Like this so i can change it later and say ""you dont know why this got so many likes"". Thnx"
The aesthetic of this thumbnail 🥹
visca el barca
Noticed that it was shot on an iPhone 15 Pro from the first minute!
"i see a new marques video, i click it , simple"
FFIRST?? FIRTS? First?? Ahhh forget it
One day after getting one lol
I guess you're a Messi fan then...🤔🤔🤔
Más de mil dólares por un teléfono
Pixel 8 Pro long-term review next ?
This might be the last video of mkbhd on 2023 😅
"Bro getting big in the shoulders, have you been working out???"
"Who else has noticed Marques' beard? 
I pray he keeps it like this. It's beautiful ❤️"
I WAS HERE
"Shot on iphone lol - it's so obvious, that fake bokeh isn't it. Great review though"
"What's the name of the weather app that you use....?

Anyone that knows to help, please."
3 months later: It's still manufactured e-waste.
MKBHD isn't pregnant but he delivers 😅
Not the ultra
Let's appreciate the hard work she puts into these videos for our entertainment❤
That tshirt tho ❤💙
"At this point we only watch your vids for your opinion period.
We love you Marques keep it up!"
"I’ve had the 15 pro for a while, haven’t used a case on it. Seriously so good without a case."
"Where is the blind test this year
Its what most want"
One of my Chrome tabs literally has Iphone 15 pro review because i was thinking of upgrading and here you are reading my mind with a banger.
Brave to wear that Jersey Marques
THE COOLEST VIDEO IDEA EVER WOULD BE one of you reviewing the new iPhone as if it was a brand new piece of tech so from the ground up like there was never a smart phone before it and then do it with the newest s series ultra and google pixel and then compare them as such.
Eu ❤❤
W beard
How accurate is blood oxygen sensor on apple watch? can you please make a video on that. Thank you!
That zoom to crop feature already existed on my Note 10 plus
Is marques A Barca fan not the first time I've seen him in the jersey
Just a lil bit early
At least put on a screen protector. Gee. The screen is the most interacted part of the phone.. no way would I not be annoyed by that gash.
Could u plz make video on the galaxy s23
I love watching thing's I can't afford 😂
I got an iPhone 15 pro for Christmas and was literally searching for iPhone 15 pro videos like 20mins ago and suddenly this popped up on my feed
Who came from X
"it's been 3 months????
TIME FLIIIES"
Team MKBHT is the best tech YouTuber ever
"Come on @MarquesBrownlee i belive you're smart!!  stop wearing that corrupted club t-shirt, Real Madrid is the Real Deal... peace!!"
"What's the need for a video like this? Oh, yeah, keep pushing the Apple envelope. Same kind of video for ANY other phone brand? NOOOOOOOO"
"That wallpaper is such a throwback!
Ghosts 2 for anyone wondering"
Pro Max heats up a lot while charging
bro is wearing spotify FC💀
First time the review will be going along with how long I’ve had the phone as well
"those who rate the barcelona kit

vvv"
"Cmon guys, the video is 10 minutes long"
Barcelona FC doing an Ad?
So meh basically.
only when we think the quality of MKBHD can’t get any better!
Hala Madrid!!!!!!!
More long term reviews is a great idea!
Could you make the same video but for the 8 Pro?
nice 👌🏾
Im too broke to go caseless lol
I got shocked when I saw the notification 😂
the little touches of blue and red in the background matching your shirt is such a cool touch - I know that was no accident
😍❤
"Marques can you make a video about the green,red,pink lines keep appearing in OLED screen phones"
Next video wear a Real Madrid jersey
3 months later: Don't buy it and get the 15 plus instead.
The Jersey!!!!🔴🔵
Marques in a Barcelona shirt is golden ❤
"Marques never disappoints us, he's an incredible Content Creator and always creates masterpieces. His content is amazing."
Forca Barca!

"amazing phone, come from 13 it's just amazing"
Nice Barca kit!
Watching this on iPhone 15 pro
Not one accidentally drop in 3 months is CRAAAAAAZY
Is the foam letters spelling pro a smartly placed snarky comment? 😂
"Got the Pro max in November, upgraded from an 11 Pro, best decision i've ever made."
"As always, outstanding video!!"
@MKBHD well done Marques!!
i clicked off when i saw the barcelona yersey
pretty new lol
MKBHD on a Barca T-shirt 😂😂. Cool. Football ⚽💪🏿
Don't wear a Barcelona t shirt!!!

Real Madrid better than Barcelona

I liked my own comment
David
Barcelona FC fan? 😂
My wish tesla electric car inshaAllah one day God give me
"""I wanna do longer term reviews"" I wholeheartedly support that style of content cuz your style is on point"
NOICE
Nobody will like this comment 😢
Who prefers the 14 Pro Max over this?
"I think I’m going to get one , I have the 12 pro max since launch. I think I’m gonna go for it."

OnePlus open later??
I really wish you would reconsider making the blind smartphone camera test video
"0:16

Watching...

Barcelona ❤️💙
Love the jersey
Only those who came from TikTok are allowed to like these video
We should talk psychedelics and apple
A perfect pro review
Thank you for doing this kind of review. Right when tech comes out reviews are great but after time reviews I really love they help me know what things are like after months and it’s all I want in a review!
FC Barcelona jersey is gonna make some noise for some
MKBHD in Barcelona kit? Bruh.
Still need to see a bit of video to decide
Are you doing one with the Pixel 8 Pro?
1st comment to decide whether i buy it or not honestly i don’t have the money
me with my 13 mini
"Cool, but I need a TV"
Stopping someone from saying first so this iPhone 15 Pro review can continue
quick pin me before android users see me.
Worst battery ever
pro max in natural titanium comes in tomorrow :)
"Hope that you had yourself a wonderful Christmas Marques and team?

Thank you."
"Let me guess. “Not much more different from the 14”.

Cheers."
